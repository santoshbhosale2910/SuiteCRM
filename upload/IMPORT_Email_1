Sorry for the confusion. I took this over from Kami and that was the number that was used at the BTN, which now explains why it was rejected in the beginning, so then I used the number that we are porting as its own BTN and in most cases it works out but it too got rejected. Could you reach out to the client to see what the BTN is for the porting number?",,,Re: Port In Request,,,,jmunk@convirza.com,,,FALSE,FALSE,3,8/19/2016 3:25:25 PM,FALSE,,TRUE,,,FALSE,500j000000Fm6WMAAZ

The first named ""Call loop ported out"" lists DID's that are no longer under
our RespOrg along with their account ID's.  Can you use the second sheet to
vlookup the account names and account managers and place them in the first
sheet and then use the DID info tool to find out which DID's are in
currently active campaigns versus in referral?  You can find this info at
the bottom of the page under ""campaign information"" and look to see when
the end dates and referral dates are.

Reach out to me with any questions, thanks!!

Nate, JP,

I think I discovered another process that needs to be addressed that may be
contributing to our number management issues.

I have attached a list of numbers with account id's that have been ported
out. These numbers still show provisioned to an account in call track,
however I believe the accounts have quit.

Can someone please address this asap.

This email is in response to a request to look in to issues with the number 801-528-7014. It was reported that there is a long pause on the customers end when they call this tracking number.

The long pause is coming from the termination side of the call, which means the number that the above tracking number forwards to. That number is 8018250737. That ring-to is a cell-phone, which is causing the long silence on the customer's end.

To get rid of the long silence, you will want to change out the 8018250737 ring-to number for another, preferably land-line, number.",,,long silence on call,,support@convirza.desk-mail.com,support@convirza.desk-mail.com,blainet@me.com,,,FALSE,FALSE,3,8/19/2016 10:13:30 PM,FALSE,,TRUE,,,FALSE,500j000000GqtgBAAR

Good Morning Jennie:

Here are the local numbers for Ron Bell.   The Socorro rate center is
depleted.   I can ask Telecom to get numbers for this rate center but it
will take a day to get the inventory.

Please test the numbers below and confirm when you have completed your test
calls.

I will keep you informed.

I just setup 2 TN's for mudlick. Both going to the same ring-to. Neither is
working and they arent playing the disclaimer, either. Please check out:
8663223122
8662370943

They only need 1. I did the second thinking the first might be a fluke. I
received the same result on both so i figured i would send both in.

I want to make sure we are all clear on the lists for August 2016 Migration and what the current status is

1)      List from Convirza, Alex sent the carrier info back to CZ. There were TF and Locals. No actions were required from the me or the DevSupport since these are numbers are in the CP hubs. Alex provided the carrier info for TF and locals

a.       Alex released the TF numbers 8/15/2016

b.      Locals waiting on Convirza


2)      2nd List for August 2016 is from CallSource, minus RL and Move.com.

a.       TF have been moved and migrated. Alex has released the numbers on 8/18/2016

b.      Locals with carrier info I will send over attached and  be labeled ""August 2016 (2nd List) Locals no RL.xlsx""


3)      3rd List of numbers for August 2016 are in pending campaigns. 7 TF

a.       Numbers have been moved into the CP hubs

b.      TFs with carrier info I will send over attached and be labeled ""TF Pending (3rd August 2016 migration).xlsx""


4)      4th  List of numbers for August 2016 are in pending campaigns (Future campaigns into 2020). 65 Locals

a.       Numbers have been moved into the CP hubs

b.      Locals with carrier info I will send over attached and be labeled ""Locals Pending (4th August 2016 migration).xlsx""

Please let me know if there are any questions.

I will review the active campaigns and the CS hubs on Friday, but I think that completes all of the regular TF and Local numbers (this is excluding RL and Move.com).  All of the media accounts are blocked from the CS hubs and should not be provisioning from them.

Thanks

Note from client:
Hi Blake,



*We have an issue with a tracking number for one of the groups under
Skyline REIT.*

*We originally created the tracking number 7057079878 <7057079878> for the
group 105 Giroux with the tag ?Skyline Website?.*


*Our client just reached out to let us know this number is no longer
connecting. When we checked for this number in convirza, it is no longer
routed under this group. When I checked the listen tab for this number, the
last call was in April!*



*We?ve had this issue before where numbers were moved or removed from our
account without us knowing, as you know.*



*Can you find this number asap, and please let us know what happened? This
client has been potentially losing calls for 5 months!*



*This is a very serious problem. We?ve had this happen before, and it was
to this client, and cannot afford this happening again.*

I will be getting this number migrated. Who is the carrier for this number, 714.243.8030?








Was told to forward this info over to you guys concerning a number port for
the below account and number. Thanks

Account - 1645490 Einstein Industries
Location - 3619025 Susan Caldwell
Number to be ported in - 714.243.8030


Notes from Case:

Looking at the number in the DID tool, the number is in a CP hub and
there is a campaign/routing already sent up. If Convirza portis it in
and it is on the Call loop, it will route.

Steve Ikeda <http://sugar.callsource.com/index.php?module=Users&action=DetailView&record=00530000000dQgtAAE>

08/22/2016 01.28pm

In this case since the number is in the Call Loop it should be ported
in by Convirza and not CS.

Liz Guzzo <http://sugar.callsource.com/index.php?module=Users&action=DetailView&record=6f4034d6-675f-b2e4-ea7a-4edf576ca5cf>

08/22/2016 01.05pm

This number was ported out but never removed from the system. Client
wants to port number back in. Eric said the following but its not
being tracked on the CS platform - Number is still on call loop Rule
ID 519379 Group 2 GW List 13 Description Einstein Industries, Inc.

08/22/2016 12.17pm

Please have Eric approve it this needs to be ported in through CS or Convirza.

When calling the tracking number for Wagner Equipment that routs through
the redaction/callfish server I get a message that all circuits are busy
now. This was reported by Wagner.

I tested from my desk phone at 2:20 MST my number is 3856953825 ""All
Circuits are busy...""
I tested from my t-mobile cell phone at 2:28 MST it just rings forever
I tested again my desk at 2:29 MST and I was able to reach the location and
speak to an employee


Tracking number - 5752001077
Ring to - 5758850229

Nether of the two times that the call connected did I hear a disclaimer and
they did not show up in the app or in the lmc2 data base. Wagner confirms
that this line should receive 6-12 calls per day and no calls are showing
up in the app.

Hello Sandra,

Please see the clients email below and assist with the request.


Hope this message finds you well. I am hoping you can help me. We have 3
call tracking numbers that I currently use for our GoogleAdwords campaign
to market Brandmuscle. Currently on the reports the Campaign Name and Ad
Source are very vague and make it difficult to utilize the reports.

I would like to update the Campaign Name and Ad Source for these numbers
but it does not look like I have a way to do that through my user account
and I'm hoping you might be able to help me. Following is how I would like
these to appear. Can you update for me or send instructions on how I can do
it? Thank you!

PORT-OUT DISCONNECTS: Please note that this report only includes TNs that
have ported away to other carriers, and does not include TNs that have
ported away internally to other Level 3 customer accounts. Level 3 will
disconnect all Telephone Numbers from your account that have ported away
from your account on the Level 3 network to stop billing. Port-out TNs will
remain on the e-mail notifications for one week after porting away before
being dropped, but can still be seen in the Portal port-out reports that
will also include any TNs porting away internally.

This is a project for Ali. Yesterday we set up this client with some new
tracking numbers and they came back saying that they need different area
codes than the ones we used. They specified which area codes they wanted to
see on the attached spreadsheet.

Please set up the new tracking numbers based on the details below and end
the existing campaigns for the old tracking numbers. Please use the
existing spreadsheet to show each new tracking number!

Let me know if you have any questions or need any clarification!

The number isn?t working. I call it and it does nothing, no noise or anything. I have it set up under the group 65 Times under master Bentall Kennedy.

Either something isn?t activated with it or I need a new number.

The client noticed a couple of calls that seemed to cut-off unexpectedly at
the end. She gave me 2 examples. Is this something you can look at to see
if someone hung up or if there was an issue on the line.

Let me know if you need other info then what is in the screenshot below.
[image: Inline image 1]
The one from 6/30 looks to me like a possible hang up by the caller but the
6/29 call seems a little strange.

I looked at the case and the CDR today.

This message is not a CallTrack msg: ""generic announcement for newly installed numbers, please use network management to replace this announcement with the desired routing for this numbers.""

The CDR today 8/25/2016 it looks like they received a connected call at 08/24/2016 Wed 1:47 PM and again at 08/24/2016 Wed 5:02 PM and I made a test call this morning and connected. ( I know I shouldn?t but if it is getting to me it must be an issue.)

Good morning Sandra,



Can you please look into the following number for me in regards of this
dealer? It looks like we have a number displayed on their Microsite that is
not within their account. We believe that the EXP date might have been
entered in wrong therefore it is not listed anymore.



The number that we need to know if it was expired that was linked up to the
dealers Microsite is 435-248-0108. Also, if it is still available for
reactivating to have it be put under this dealers account. Please let me
know about this as soon as possible if you can!",,,Fwd: 55233 - Extreme Satellites - URGENT,,sharo@convirza.com,sharo@convirza.com,support@convirza.com; mcorrea@convirza.com,,,TRUE,FALSE,3,8/25/2016 4:28:47 PM,FALSE,,TRUE,,,FALSE,500j000000HBHm0AAH

Darren called to let me know that their client found a 3rd number not
working thats on their website.
6137030281

This one is still listed in the app. It rings to a fast busy signal when
called.

I test called the other 2 numbers in the 746 Laflin Apts sub-group and
found one more doing the same thing:
6137030285

They are both set as IVR routes.

In the app they do show calls as recently as yesterday though.

This case came back apparently there are issues with the CallShield.  I don?t touch operational items.

You know your team can turn off CallShield at the Site level if it is a problem.  If your support team needs help with that setting ask someone in CC at CallSource.

Subject: August 2016 Migration lists and status

Hi All,

I want to make sure we are all clear on the lists for August 2016 Migration and what the current status is

1)      List from Convirza, Alex sent the carrier info back to CZ. There were TF and Locals. No actions were required from the me or the DevSupport since these are numbers are in the CP hubs. Alex provided the carrier info for TF and locals

a.       Alex released the TF numbers 8/15/2016

b.      Locals waiting on Convirza


2)      2nd List for August 2016 is from CallSource, minus RL and Move.com<http://move.com>.

a.       TF have been moved and migrated. Alex has released the numbers on 8/18/2016

b.      Locals with carrier info I will send over attached and  be labeled ?August 2016 (2nd List) Locals no RL.xlsx?


3)      3rd List of numbers for August 2016 are in pending campaigns. 7 TF

a.       Numbers have been moved into the CP hubs

b.      TFs with carrier info I will send over attached and be labeled ?TF Pending (3rd August 2016 migration).xlsx?


4)      4th  List of numbers for August 2016 are in pending campaigns (Future campaigns into 2020). 65 Locals

a.       Numbers have been moved into the CP hubs

b.      Locals with carrier info I will send over attached and be labeled ?Locals Pending (4th August 2016 migration).xlsx?

Please let me know if there are any questions.

I will review the active campaigns and the CS hubs on Friday, but I think that completes all of the regular TF and Local numbers (this is excluding RL and Move.com<http://move.com>).  All of the media accounts are blocked from the CS hubs and should not be provisioning from them.

Thanks

I have been alerted to some cases asking to delete some numbers that have been ported away but they seem to be lacking some info. We want to make sure we marking the correct number in the system.

Subject Title: DID ported away from Convirza (Count of DID)

Description: These DID have been port away from Convirza

Identify the following
Account:
Customer:
Campaign:
DID XXXXXXXXXX
The current hub the DID is in one of the CP hubs.

The AM should end the campaign as of that date of the case or email with the default referral period.

The hub the number is going into is the following
TF go to 1091 and are set to status 3 Deleted.
Locals go to 1096 and are set to status 3 Deleted.

Lastly. We want to make sure you are in the loop on these case and your approval needs to be in the case, an email attached or even a statement that you approve it in the description.

Thanks,
Steve Ikeda

We have re-added the groups.  You can login at your level and see the call details with recordings now.  However, I'm not seeing any users that were associated with these groups. So  you may need to grant access to your clients by adding them in the ""Users and Groups"" page.

There is not a way to do this in the app but we can send an excel sheet with links associate with each call. Where you would be able to click the link and listen to the call.  I would just need to know what is the group name of the client in the app and the time frame.  Also, I assume you would want to extend the life of the link from 4 hours to something like 90 days. 

Another option is we can have our development team load the calls on a thumb drive and send it to your client but there would be a fee associated with this option. If interested, Blake can help you with the pricing. 

Please let us know what you would like to do moving forward.

I had to submit Jira tickets as some of the routes would not delete out of

the below account and number. Thanks

Account - 1645490 Einstein Industries
Location - 3619025 Susan Caldwell
Number to be ported in - 714.243.8030


Notes from Case:

Looking at the number in the DID tool, the number is in a CP hub and
there is a campaign/routing already sent up. If Convirza portis it in
and it is on the Call loop, it will route.

Steve Ikeda <http://sugar.callsource.com/index.php?module=Users&action=DetailView&record=00530000000dQgtAAE>

08/22/2016 01.28pm

In this case since the number is in the Call Loop it should be ported
in by Convirza and not CS.

Liz Guzzo <http://sugar.callsource.com/index.php?module=Users&action=DetailView&record=6f4034d6-675f-b2e4-ea7a-4edf576ca5cf>

08/22/2016 01.05pm

This number was ported out but never removed from the system. Client
wants to port number back in. Eric said the following but its not
being tracked on the CS platform -   Number is still on call loop Rule
ID 519379 Group 2 GW List 13 Description Einstein Industries, Inc.

Sandra Haro <http://sugar.callsource.com/index.php?module=Users&action=DetailView&record=00530000000e88pAAA>

08/22/2016 12.17pm

Please have Eric approve it this needs to be ported in through CS or Convirza.

I have just spoken with our support team and they are aware of your issues
and are working with the telecoms team to get things resolved for you
including switching one or more of your numbers to a new carrier. Someone
will be reaching out to you shortly, if they haven't done so already. No
excuses. We want to make sure you are taken care of.

As for the invoices, those are automated. They go out on the scheduled date
regardless of other issues on your account. So I'm sorry you received your
monthly invoice at the same time you have a support ticket in play.

If you don't have a resolution shortly, please feel free to reach out to me
personally and I will help make sure we get you taken care of.

Wendy is out of office today, she should  be back in tomorrow, I have taken over the case for today.  I spoke with Mike Ziolkowski advising him of some adjustments we have made in conjunction with our carrier. In fact, we moved one number from one carrier to another entirely.  I'm not sure if he's spoken to you or not. We spoke about 2 hours ago.    We're hopeful the adjustments have fixed the call quality issues.  He was going to monitor calls closely for the next while and provide any new examples going forward.  We are in standby awaiting his feedback.

Hi Team,

I have been working with Marcus on some numbers that have been down for
Reach Local. Marcus found that KAM rules had not been applied to the 7
numbers I have sent over. Reach wants to make sure that all their numbers
are routing correctly. They have over 100k numbers and I am attaching their
current active numbers list.

Was there a batch of numbers that migrated from CS recently? Is there
anyway to identify what numbers moved so we can check KAM rules on them?

Could you please let me know long you think this will take so I can let
Reach Local now. Questions, please let me know.

Thank you :)

Normally we can bulk delete tracking number pools.    However, I'm running into an issue doing the bulk delete so we need to do this manually.  

This is not priority but should be done relatively soon.   

Postman isn't really any faster than manually deleting groups in this case.  

Please login to CQM and assume the following Identity.
Health Grades - Company Admin (rbeieler@healthgrades.com)

Audrey,



Sorry, I had been out of the office until yesterday so I just got around to
prioritizing this. Anyway, I have attached the spreadsheet that I built
that I think should meet your guidelines you mentioned below.



Note: I added a 4th ""campaign"" to each location in anticipation of future
ones, but at this time I don't know what that is.



The only other thing is I didn't know if you needed me to generate the
target numbers, or if that's something that automatically happens in an
upload process. I just didn't want to go through all that just to find out
there is no need for me to do that in advance.



Thanks for your help with all this!!

I would speak with the website developers and make sure it will be a
seamless process to change it out.



After that, it is just going in and setting up the numbers.  I can help you
set up numbers with support if you get us a spreadsheet of location name,
campaign name, ad source, target number and if you want a local or a
tollfree number.



Let me know how we can help!

So I want to do some of this today, before I am out of the office for three
business days. With that said, I realize there is a potentially *a ton* of
leg work in changing over all 41 locations worth of Google Business pages
and Commercial Tire locations pages. The good thing is, I bet 60% of our
traffic comes from those two sources; we just have to assign tracking
numbers to the correct keywords.



Anyway, I doubt there is, but is there any advice for doing this is the
most timely fashion?



Thanks!

Wow, I'm impressed (that was fast)!



The next assignment would be setting up the ""campaigns"" and ""call-flows"".
Are you ready to start setting up tracking numbers?



The directions are on page 5 of the quick guide.



I have attached a Google Universal Analytics Integration technical brief
sheet.  Please keep in mind, Google Analytics consider a call an ""event""
(this sometimes confuses clients).



Let me know if you need me to jump in and help you.

Audrey,



I have gone through and created all the groups/sub groups, as well as added
our Google Analytics code.



I have not added the read-only people for each zone because it would send
them the email and we're not quite set up enough to show them how it all
works.



From here, what would you say would be my next 'assignment' so we can keep
the ball rolling on this?



Thanks again!!

There are 3 role types: Admin, Standard, Read-Only

*Admin*

         Can manage all Groups, Users, Campaigns, Call Flows, Call

they are added as an owner to a Campaign

I'm looking forward to our partnership and helping Commercial Tires grow. I

Hey Audrey,

To set up a whisper greeting, do you need a recorded audio file or can you
just enter text into the box? I am trying to set one up for Best Home
Services and it doesn't seem to be working with just text. Just trying to
figure out if I'm doing something wrong or if I am just misunderstanding.

Thank you!

Hello Andrea,

We ran a connectivity test on all numbers currently provisioned in the account. It appears the 866-712-7087<tel:866-712-7087> tracking line is not connecting and needed to be replaced.

Hi Andrea,
      I was just speaking with someone from Orbera who was getting information on a patient and he mentioned that our toll free number is not working?I told him the best number to call is the 561-500-4673<tel:561-500-4673>. He said that I would need to get in touch with you because you set us up with a different number. I don?t know if we do have a toll free one lol? Sasha knows best but if we do apparently it isn?t working and they have been looking us up online to call us. Please let me know what you think.

Thank You,

Hi Frank,

Could you turn off all the ?Online? Campaigns and just leave the ?Offline:
RADIO? campaign. There is way too much noise for our customers and it make
the data almost impossible to analyze.

Frank, some confusion here.  What phone number was replaced for the bad
number 866-712-7087?  Looking at your vertical column below, which one
replaced it so we can update our website for the Surgeon?s inbound calls.

Hey guys-

Sorry to be a pest lately but I?m trying to go through all my outstanding
emails and I noticed that the number associated with FL Bariatric &
Wellness on Orbera.com is still not working.  They just started a digital
campaign this week with us/Watrous so is it possible to get this remedied
soon?

While auditing this I noticed that the Kirkwood - 30TN call flow was not
created. This has now been added.

It appears that the issue causing inactive call flows is persistent. I am

authentication to the Convirza webhook.  

 

Do we need to revise the code sent over by Convirza to include this before
providing to our web hosting company to add to our site?

 

From Elizabeth:

 

I added some simple authentication to the application in the form of the
user table.  So, Skip, when you configure the convirza webhook, you should
use the following:

 

user=convirza

authkey=1dbd3cd7-7e04-4ae7-9d36-caacc19467a8

 

If for any reason you want to change this, you can do it through
pyhpmyadmin.

So I would go ahead and configure the webhook and start sending the data.
Let me know when you do it, as I will want to verify that it is completely
working.

Brian!)  Below is what Janice said. Please let me know what you'd like me
to tell her:

Hi Lindsey,

I am not sure what the choices are?we are currently enrolled in the

Performance level, so not sure what else is available.

I did notice that there is a Standard option at $29/month, which had

fewer call recording minutes with a slightly higher charge for additional

minutes?and wondering if that would suit our needs.



The issue is that only 2 of the clubs are utilizing the option of listening

to the calls, so would like to know what the next level down might be.



I would have to ask if the clubs are using the Conversation Analytics,

which I don?t believe they are, as I see that is a difference between

the two options.



Thanks for your help.

were getting value out of CA, that they wouldn't be considering dropping
down.

It sounds like this is for someone on support or an AM and not us. I would
recommend seeing how many minutes they get. She obviously wants to drop to
$29. It may not save her money.

Someone needs to have a discussion with them about improving their
marketing with the data. This isn't just about listening to calls but
tracking he marketing.

Also, we need to push some CA their way if it's not already happening. A
call with Janice is needed. More understanding of their usage is needed.

Their most recent invoice was for $264.79. It is attached. I called Janice this morning, and discussed their needs and usage. I'll have another call later with their people who actually login and use the application. Please see desk case 220105 for more details.

They used 1,115 minutes across 5 numbers last month. If they were to downgrade to the $29 plan they would have no extra number charges, and 1,115 used minutes-600 base minutes = 515 extra minutes. 515*$.079/minute for the $29 plan = $40.685 total extra monthly minutes charges, plus the base of 29 = 69.688. So, they would save about $195.10 or 74% on their monthly cost with a downgrade.

I was just recently given a login for your site to access our calls.  I am having an issue where I can only hear the caller and not the representative who took the call.  I spoke with our IT department and they suggested this may have been a setting put in place on your side.

Is there an option somewhere on the site, that perhaps I overlooked, that would enable me to hear both parties on the call?

Thanks in advance for your help!

Hello Megan,



I was looking at the Traffic Analysis for a client and noticed they had 12
missed calls on Monday, August 22nd, between 3:19 p.m. and 3:31 p.m. (see
detail below)



There are some calls longer than 1 min. Is it possible that the system
didn?t mark them as answered? Can you help me find out if there was an
issue with your service at that time or the target number?



Thank you,

PORT-OUT DISCONNECTS: Please note that this report only includes TNs that
have ported away to other carriers, and does not include TNs that have
ported away internally to other Level 3 customer accounts. Level 3 will
disconnect all Telephone Numbers from your account that have ported away
from your account on the Level 3 network to stop billing. Port-out TNs will
remain on the e-mail notifications for one week after porting away before
being dropped, but can still be seen in the Portal port-out reports that
will also include any TNs porting away internally.

to quickly find these routes, click the ""tracking number"" column twice -
these are Number Pools, so they have Names instead of numbers, and will be

Can you please add Call Loop translations to this number?  It's been

After talking with our development team it looks like we will not be able to transfer the history of the calls into the new platform because they use different databases. So you would have to save history through excel. If you still want to access the history in the app you will need keep the CQM account open.

You will be able to keep your UA for Google Analytics and it will not disrupt the data. Also, when listening to calls you do not have the ability to drag through out the call but instead skip 5 secs head.

I can set up the subscription tomorrow so you can go in and check out the platform.  Then on the first of September we can transfer numbers if you feel comfortable. Let me know what sounds like the best options for you.

Thank you for reaching out to Convirza. We fully understand the frustration you are experiencing with downloading and viewing reports in Excel.

The issue you are experiencing is related to recent security updates from Microsoft (KB3115262, KB3115322, and KB3115322). In interest of your personal security Microsoft has changed the opening behavior of files accessed from the internet. These updates were released without announcement from Microsoft and are preventing you from accessing your reports as you have in the past. 


To access your reports we suggest one of the following options.

Option 1: Save the file to your local machine. Right click the file name. Click ""Properties"". Then click ""Unblock"" next to the following warning message: ""This file came from another computer and might be blocked to help protect this computer. 

Option 2. Create a folder for your reports. Add this folder to the Trusted Locations list in Excel. An article on adding to your Trusted Locations list can be found on the Microsoft Office Support page using the following URL: https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-remove-or-change-a-trusted-location-7ee1cdc2-483e-4cbb-bcb3-4e7c67147fb4",,,RE: Report Follow-up,,support@convirza.com,support@convirza.com,pgrose@michigan.com,,,FALSE,FALSE,3,8/30/2016 2:24:17 PM,FALSE,,TRUE,,,FALSE,500j000000HDV8VAAX

Bandwidth regularly updates our coverage matrix which involves the addition and removal of rate centers both on and off net; in this instance, we lost coverage for the rate center that housed these numbers. Because they were off net, they were returned to our off net vendor, Thinktel. The issue was discovered during your migration from the My.Bandwidth portal to the Bandwidth Dashboard. Unfortunately, it looks like this was not communicated by us during this process, which exacerbated the confusion on your end. I apologize for the lack of communication here.

been reserved to their account for over a month. In july they requested to
have 50 numbers added to their reserve and these were some of the numbers
given to us by telecom. This completely defeats that purpose.

Why do they need to give these numbers away?
Why were unuable numbers assigned to their account?
Are there other unusable numbers in their reserve right now?

Hi Brett,



As a follow up from our phone conversation, and now completely
understanding the difference in plans, we would like to switch back to our
original plan, of $399 and 100 numbers a month.



I am going to go in and try and release some of our older numbers this week.



Please let me know when our account information can be reverted back.

Thanks,

From the invoice it looks like you had 116 additional phone numbers this
month. The 199 plan only comes with 10 numbers included, the previous plan
you were on came with 100 numbers so that may be the discrepancy.

What I mean is the $199 plan comes with 10 tracking numbers included with
the plan and anything over 10 you will pay $3.00 per number per month. The
$399 plan you are on now inlcudes 100 numbers so I wanted to make sure you
were aware of the difference before we make the switch.

I look after our websites at Weed Man USA (we have an account with you).
Are you familiar with a sites N.A.P. score? I?m worried changing our phone

What suggestions do you have?



Thank you,

We are indeed familiar with N.A.P. score. Our Dynamic Number Insertion (DNI) feature provides the solution here. With DNI a pool of numbers are swapped out for the original number by javascript on your webpage after the page loads, allowing you to track calls online at the individual user level, without suffering any effect on your SEO. I've linked some relevant literature below. Please have a look, and then get back to me when/if you'd like to setup DNI and we can go over it with you.

I inquired about the two additional numbers not working on your account: 
7784362106, 7784362167
and found they were ported out at the same time as the previous number you alerted us to: 7784362122. 

We have added the numbers to the same dispute.  Interestingly, these were ported back to the service we ported them from - Stormcloud Networks, who operated Admetrics, if that points to who might have initiated the port out?

Our telecom department advised 8663222922 was in our inventory in error, and we are not able to secure the number.  A new number will need to be provisioned in this situation.  If desired, I can help you set it up and swap it out on our DNI page.  Please let me know if you'd like me to change it for you.  

I reviewed what we were seeing on YBA Shirts web site, where both their unique and a generic Google Analytics account number is being passed, and we believe it is a bug that allows the generic account to be passed.  I have opened up a bug report on the issue.  From what we can see, it does not seem to be interfering with the data, but please let me know if you see it cause integration issues.

I understand your concern, however the port was neither initiated nor approved by our company.  Porting happens strictly at the carrier level and we are not notified until after it happens, and are usually notified monthly of numbers removed from our service through porting, which means our customers are often aware of an issue prior to us being notified.
  
Porting could only occur if the correct information is presented to our carrier, so it must have been submitted with your company information, as that was how we ported it in.  That does not mean it was someone in your company, but since it ported back to the same company we ported from, they would have had all that data.  

The dispute process was designed for these types of scenarios, and we have been very successful in the past retrieving numbers ported out in error.  We have all the tracking information to back up the fact these have been in service and in use on your account so I believe we will be successful in getting the numbers back.",,,Re: Tracking Numbers not working,,support@convirza.desk-mail.com,support@convirza.desk-mail.com,dminard@infotel.ca,,,FALSE,FALSE,3,8/31/2016 10:38:28 PM,FALSE,,TRUE,,,FALSE,500j000000HmBbMAAV

Hi!

Could you please include the entire campaign for these (tracking number,
target number, etc--the whole row).  You can just copy each and paste above
the routing menus. Also, please put the location names above each
campaign.  Right now I believe they are labeled by ad source, so you can
just swap out for location name where you currently have the ad source name
as the header.


Thank you!

This is the Parker Hannifin number that you have escalated because we kept getting rejections on it. This number has not ported nor have we gotten a FOC date. As Eric has sent you earlier. We have re-submitted this number. I will keep you informed on CASE #193718





Jason,

I have reviewed this with Erica, we will try one more submission to this carrier. If it is unsuccessful we will attempt the port with another carrier

To date we have provided the a Partial Bill, a Full Bill, the CSR, LOA, and POF and it is still getting rejected due to the BTN. 

The first port request was denied when the ring to number was used as the BTN, then when it was resubmitted with the CSR another random number was used for the BTN and it was rejected again. After trying a third time the carrier rejected because the port number was not on the CSR. I found the port number on page 21 of the CSR and we tried resubmitting for a fourth time but it to was rejected becouse the BTN was not on the CSR.

After reviewing the set up on these numbers, I have found how and why the numbers ""appear"" to be on the correct group, but calls are showing up under the main group ""Tap Publishing.""  

You can see what I'm looking at in this screenshot: http://screencast.com/t/sOMq9LpeyFY 

The number is set to the correct group, in this case ""NT-BALL VOLVO-142198"", but under the IVR options, the ""Assigned to"" group is showing ""Tap Publishing.""  This feature allows one IVR to be set up for several associated groups,  and will groups calls according to customer selection. 

 In this case, I believe all calls would go to the group the number is associated with, so I have updated the routes you sent me accordingly.  I have also moved the calls associated with these numbers into the group the number is on.  I pulled all calls back to June 1, and have attached the list here.

Thank you for your follow-up.  2 things. 

1. This telephone number, 4125899983, is already being processed on another order:
  Therefore, it is not portable.

2. For all other numbers we received a rejection for the following reasons:  ""Vendor Error Remarks: Address mismatch (Q02 ADDRESS MISMATCH), Name Mismatch (Q01 NAME MISMATCH), Address mismatch (E1), Address Mismatch (ADDRESS MISMATCH)"".

JP and I spoke to Ed Hart regarding his need for cancelling. He likes
Convirza and has had a positive experience with us however they are down
sizing at the moment and don't have anyone in house that can manage their
call tracking data. They are outsourcing this piece of their business until
they can ramp up and do some more internal hiring. We are going to get back
with them at the beginning on this next year to see if we can win their
business back.

We will need to cancel them out by the end of this month.

Thank you

PORT-OUT DISCONNECTS: Please note that this report only includes TNs that
have ported away to other carriers, and does not include TNs that have
ported away internally to other Level 3 customer accounts. Level 3 will
disconnect all Telephone Numbers from your account that have ported away
from your account on the Level 3 network to stop billing. Port-out TNs will
remain on the e-mail notifications for one week after porting away before
being dropped, but can still be seen in the Portal port-out reports

Sending you information in response to your request for transferring your phone number(s) to Convirza.  Attached are the Porting FAQs along with the required documents you will want to complete and return to begin this process. 

When you're ready to submit the request to port your numbers please return the following required documentation:

- Copy of most recent bill from the current (losing) carrier
- Convirza Resporg Letter of Authorization (LOA) and/or Local LOA (We would like a separate LOA based on the type of number)
- Number Port Order Form (If you have more than 10 numbers please include the information needed on an Excel Spreadsheet)

Once we have the completed documentation we will process your request. If everything is in order you can expect to get a status on the request in 5-7 business days.

I have left a message for Real Page and will follow up with them tomorrow first thing so hopefully we can move forward.  I am surprised it took so long for this error message.  You would have thought that they would have discovered this right after I sent the information 2 weeks ago.


As far as #1 problem below- I am confused - this is the number that Real Page had set them up with. It goes to 412-702-9300.  It was set up just like all of the other numbers so I am not sure why this is different and not able to be ported then any of the other numbers.
Please let me know how we can make this work

Our service is by Blue Line.   Bright House is the telephone company in the area.  So not sure if you need to contract Blue Line or Brighthouse.  I put down the Blue Line info since they bill us.

We need to coordinate the cut over so please call me 2 days before the actual port over.   Can you also confirm that you received this information?

Hi Marty,

Can you please provision a new tracking phone number for 888 Heating. It
appears they are getting many calls for the previous owner of the current

Like email notifications and such?)

Please see the attached documents on porting in numbers. You will also need a receipt or paid invoice on the numbers you are looking to port in to show there are no dues for the loosing carrier. Are any of the numbers you are looking to port in toll-free numbers?

Hi Audrey,



I hope all is well. I know you wanted to kind of go over everything first
but this came up kind of urgently. I was wondering if you could get some
new tracking numbers for us ? we have two new acquisitions in British
Columbia in Sidney and Oak Bay. The ring-to numbers are:



-          250-370-2833 (Oak Bay/Victoria)

-          250-656-2218 (Sidney)



I was also hoping they could be local (250) numbers. The account is under
Brittany?s email address. Please let me know as soon as you can if this can
be done or if there?s anything else you need.



Thanks,

Ryan

Dear Brittany Cruise and The Helix Hearing Care Team,

I am writing to introduce myself as your new Account Manager. I recently
took over your account and will now be responsible for making sure all your
needs are met with the highest service with Convirza and its platforms.

My hope is to discuss the needs of your business with you sometime within
the next two weeks. Please let me know when would be a convenient time for
you by responding to this email. I will contact you on the number I have
associated with your account at the end of the two-week period if I have
not heard from you.

As your new Account Manager, I look forward to assisting you in making your
business grow.

Best Regards,

Audrey Gallegos

Hello Brett:

I've received authorization from Mediagistic to release the tracking
numbers listed below.  These numbers are currently on the CallSource
platform.   Ask Telecom how to proceed with moving the numbers, these are
on Call Loop and in the Contact Point hub 1002.

Please let me know how I can further assist you.   Thank you.

This sounds like something local. You can ask them to update their PIN, try from a cell phone and from a desk phone...if it doesn't work from a desk phone, chances are they aren't out pulsing DTMF properly from their PBX


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Marcus Nielsen | SEP 08, 2016 | 01:15PM MDT

Eric I'm not sure on this one. I made the same test calls and had no trouble connecting, or calling out. Is there somewhere else to look?

Chamber Discoveries
OUID 30018
Case: 196334

Customer reporting issues with outbound number 4149397699. Current PIN set
to 7699.  When they first reported, I re-saved with new pin, and have
tested multiple times, and each time it gives me prompt to enter 10 digit
TN (i.e. I cannot get it to fail,) however customer cannot get it to work -
it keeps giving him ""please enter pin.""  Is there anything more to look at?

numbers. This happens a good amount of the time, only with people that call
the call source number. I make and receive a high volume of calls and no
one calling the other numbers has had any problem.

Let me know if you need more information.

Thank you

David,
This is the response I received from Call Source. Can you help provide more
information for them by responding to this email? It sounds like there is
an issue with your phone lines or service, but I am not sure.
Thank-you for your help.

Our telecom team is not able to find any issue with the connection on the
calls. They appear to connect, and then be voluntarily disconnected. Can
you describe in more details what is happening? Is it a sound quality issue
where you cannot hear the person on the other line?
Respectfully,

Gabriel Campbell

We've seen increasing slowness in the CQM App around reporting over the
past month. Today we did a deep dive and found that for Reports in general,
there are Summary numbers loaded and one of the counts around Webhooks
Triggered is executing a query against 22.6mil records taking >4min to
complete. In some cases, this long running query caused the RDS server to
not respond and the queries needing to be terminated. Terminating queries
has caused other ripple effects with specific customers.

The issue is the number of Webhook_Logs in the table is growing at an
exponential rate and searching against all records for specific
Call_Detail_IDs every second is taxing on the system causing low
performance.

After this discovery we added some indexes today that allow fast searches
in memory based on Call_Detail_IDs and found that it significantly
increased the performance of the reports. We also found that the green icon
issue of not pulling up details when calls are mined is now responding
quickly as well.

Let me know if you feel this optimization improves the overall performance
for demos and general use.

Thanks,
Jeff

Is it a possibility for you to provision and use new numbers? Are your current tracking numbers not on an advertisement that is out somewhere? Because if you could just replace your current numbers with others that work, that would certainly be easier (assuming that the problem is with the tracking numbers in the first place).

If you do this, please provision and thoroughly test the new tracking number to make sure that the issue does not persist.

The time showing on the email is how we store call detail information.

I need your assistance in moving a tracking number that is currently
provisioned to CFA account Ad Mix Social OUID: 2799. This tracking number
needs to be moved to CFA account Phoenix Endodontics OUID: 3489.

Phoenix Endodontics is Ad Mix Social but they wanted to split their account
so each of their clients can be billed separately.

Tracking line to move: 6027484190


Thank you

So we were on the call yesterday and we spoke to Erica. Here is the current status.

We have given you all of the TF and Locals to be migrated in August outside of some local numbers (4) that were recoveries in late August. I will send those over once I get carrier info and move to CP hubs.

This all excludes the Reach and Move numbers.

Reminder that there is a 45 day hold on numbers that have ended. This started in late August.  When will you be sending a list of numbers you want to remove from the Call Loop?

Thanks,
Steve Ikeda

Jeremiah would like to invite all of you to his house on Wednesday for the
upcoming Power Training Graduation Ceremony. Dinner (mouth-watering pizza
and creamy root beer floats) will be provided! If you'd like to attend, the
event will kick off at 4:00pm. Here is his address: 754 W Marsh Cove,
Draper, UT 84020.

Regarding the company meeting, we will be holding it at Camp Williams, in
the Officers Club: 17800 South Camp Williams Road, Bluffdale, UT 84065. I
attached a map with detailed directions. *Please note, you must bring your
driver?s license with you so you can get in.*

Let me know if you have any questions. (And before you close this email,
turn to the employee next to you and repeat the following with gusto: Hey
awesome co-worker, *bring your driver?s license with you** to Camp Williams*
or they won?t let you in!""

Have a great weekend everyone.

As a result of Power Training and the company offsite, support will be
running with a significant reduction in staff this week. Can we move all of
the deleted tracking numbers to the misdial pool in an effort to reduce the
amount of misdial calls we get in the support que? We had a significant
increase in the amount of misdial calls we received last week. I would like
to prevent that this week.

Thank You

We're taking a look at your full list of numbers and the associated calls. Could you give us the date range of the calls that were not invoiced to your client and that you are requesting the credit on?

We would also like to know who setup these routes in the first place, to determine if the groups were misallocated to begin with. We see they were setup around April 12th or 13th. Do you know who on your end sets up the routes in the app?

Also, for any given tracking number that is setup, the correct group must be applied to both the tracking and the target ends of the route. We want to make sure that this is clear so that we don't run in to this problem again.

We'd like to take this opportunity to offer to audit all of your 448 routes to ensure the group and ring-to group assignments are what they should be across your account.

That number was indeed provisioned by a Best Buy in Springfield up through May of this year, before they ended their campaign and relinquished the number back to the number pool where it could be provisioned again. Once in the pool, a used number will wait for a period of time, typically 30-60 days, until it stops receiving calls (this is called 'cleaning'), at which point it becomes available to be provisioned again by someone else. Very rarely, a number will get through and be eligible to be re-provisioned before it is fully cleaned, and the new business will get calls from the customers of the old business. Or, sometimes this happens because there is a miscommunication at the old business, and they start advertising a number again that they no longer own without realizing it, directing their customers to the number's new owner.

I have contacted this Best Buy in Springfield Oregon at (541) 736-1127 to see if we can get them to pull down their advertisements or online postings with this number on it. They forwarded me to someone at their corporate office, who submitted a ticket there to have the number taken off of their White Pages listing and anywhere else it might be. So, hopefully they will take that advertisement down, and they claim that they will get back to me once it has been done, or if they have any further questions.",,,"Re: FW: Fitness 1440-Eugene, OR",,support@convirza.com,support@convirza.com,jeff@muscleupmarketing.com,,,FALSE,FALSE,3,09-12-2016 19:01,FALSE,,TRUE,,,FALSE,500j000000IPzgLAAT

The date range of calls would be from July 21 through August 20. Melissa
Riley, who I believe you have spoken with before about the problem we were
having around the first week of August, sets up the majority of the routes.
We have had the same process for quite a while now, with the only change
being we email your customer support to set up the IVR portion of the call
tracking. This was a process implemented early this year if I remember
correctly.

We are clear on double checking to make sure all points of the routing are
connected to the correct grouping now. I would welcome you to do the audit
of our current number to ensure the correct routing is in place.

Thank you,

My name is Armand Emmott, the company I work for is Springfield News-Leader.

I spoke with Gabriel earlier today regarding reactivation of certain tracking numbers.

Here are the three #'s I'm trying to reactivate:


-          888.706.9105 (Jamie Hathcock Auto)

o   Default target is 417.862.9000

-          877.819.0223 (Metro Motors)

o   Default target is 417.882.6800

-          888.470.3114 (Lindsay Auto)

o   Default target is 417.532.3114

Can you help me set these up?

Marty, 
We are having issues when dialing the (844)473-3770 number.  I believe this
was not targeted to the correct number.  When dialing it, I am not getting a
fax beep.  Instead I am getting a greeting with menu options.

Can you please check into this.

We would like to move forward with 1 vanity phone number as well as 5
additional central phone numbers as we previously discussed. One of them
will be used for radio so if it could be one that is easy to remember, that
would be great. (ex repetitive numbers, etc.)

Thanks!
Lizzie

It was great connecting with you this morning on this request. As suggested, Jason will be unavailable until Friday. The support team is happy to assist any way we can in the meantime. 

I pulled a list of the vanity numbers that are currently available with the letters you suggested. The following are currently available from our vanity partners. Please send me back your top 3 choices so I can work on getting one of them for you. 

I'll order the number for you. I'll let Jason work with you on the vanity agreement when he gets back.

I've attempted to call a few times this morning to assist you with this. I keep getting a message that says ""All circuits are busy now. Please try your call again later."" The number we have on file is: 954-200-9925. Is that still a good contact number?

My franchise 255-83 is indicating that their customer Venture Pest Control has stopped receiving the notifications emails for tracking # 678-337-1075.  They said it was working great last month, but stopped all of a sudden.

Would it be possible to check and see if there is any issue associated with it?  I know they've received a few calls this month that don't have the notification associated with it.

Thanks,

I can check the availability of those numbers for you. 

Do they have to be 800 vanities? Or can I look for the same things for the other toll-free area codes?

I just called and left you a voice message. I wanted to follow-up here as well.

The issue you reported where the reports are not populating today's data has been reported to our development team. They are currently working on it. I will follow-up once it has been resolved. 

I also reported the issue regarding not being able to rename campaigns. They are going to add it to our next sprint. In the meantime, I would like to get everything named correctly on the back-end. I would like to coordinate how you would like them renamed so we can change this for you. How would you like to coordinate that.

I have been trouble shooting this issue, and I think they are being blocked in some way.  

Is it possible the client desk phone shows something other than their direct number?  It might be blocking based on a different caller ID.  For instance, if the caller's phone shows a toll free number on their outbound caller ID, it might get blocked where their direct number would not be blocked.  

Is it possible this is contributing?",,,Re: Fwd: Issues with 800-442-2773,,support@convirza.com,support@convirza.com,tambarsoumian@gmail.com,mjackson@convirza.com,,FALSE,FALSE,3,9/13/2016 8:11:45 PM,FALSE,,TRUE,,,FALSE,500j000000IQbWCAA1

I found several that end with ""chill"" and two that start with ""chill"" (888-CHILL34, 866-CHILL73).  Would those work for you? The rest of the options were too limited. I could check with out premium vanity partners. They usually charge a bit more. Would you like me to check there as well?

Would you like me to start the process on any of the ""chill"" ones that are available? Or check with our premium vanity partners to see if they have anything with CBAYNOW, CHILLOUT, or CHILLIN?

Marty,

Today we had a few instances, but I?m unable to match them up to your tracking system.

Around 2:52 ish there was a call from 817-253-2562 where the guy said he got disconnected when calling.
We had a voicemail that had static around 2:49 and the system said it was from a number 267-249-4225.

When I went to review calls in the tracking system, I noticed that call ID 25602 was connected but it is like no one ever answered on our end.  Not sure where the call went.

Hi Tim:

I've placed test calls today.   Attached is the CallDetails report for your review.

I will continue to monitor and see if we can capture calls with audio quality issues.  I need to provide our Network Operations Center with at least 3 samples, they have a 24 hour window to locate the call in the call logs.   Please let me know if the issue persists so I can test and capture some samples for my team.

Hi Tim:

My Network Operations Center has asked for test calls and we have been attempting today to no avail, we keep getting a voicemail that goes to Kelly.

We need to replicate the issue, we have a window of 24 hours to have our Engineering team capture the call log to research what is going on.

We will continue with test calls on Monday and continue to monitor this situation.  Please let us know if this issue persists.   Thank you!

Hi Marty,

We seem to be having a quality issue with tracking number (888) 869-7744<tel:%28888%29%20869-7744>.  There is like a slight buzzing when either party is talking.  You can pretty much listen to any call for the last several days.  Most of them are going to our voicemail system.  On a few calls (which I cannot actually match up by time or number) the call is so poor that we cannot understand the callers message.  So whatever we hear in the recordings is getting amplified by my recording system.  It is almost like a frame alignment / timing issue.   You can hear it slightly on call number 25285.  There are also several calls that appear to be answered, but no one hears anything from our side.  You hear dead air, and then the customer say hi or ?hello??.  An example of a dead air call is 25250. I couldn?t find one that had someone say hi during.

There is also a call 25252 that I have no idea what happened.  It just keeps ringing.  But our answering machine should have picked up after 4 rings.  I don?t remember what happens if we don?t have any free voice channels on our voicemail system.

The two voicemail?s that we have said that they came from the following numbers.  Maybe your engineers can make sense of it, but they don?t match any caller numbers.  These are numbers that my system picks up when the caller leaves a message.  Not the number left in the message mostly because we cannot hear / understand the message.

Good Morning, Nathan!

I'm in the process of setting up a call tracking number Kia Auto Dealership.  Would it be possible to get a toll free number that ends in 542, which would stand for ""KIA""?

Please advise.

> Can someone call someone to expedite and be sure we get this resolved asap?  I will do it myself if I need to.  Just let me know who to call (I am just concerned that I would not be able to resolve it as it is not my expertise and they will like ask for info not available to me).  I am worried that we will wait for a response, have another fluky issue, and be back to square one and we are almost out of time.  Something is not right and my mailing postmarks on Friday.  I am not sure who should call to escalate and expedite so I am copying in Amisha and Marty.  I can?t afford phone interruption when the mailing hits homes.  It could have a serious financial impact to my clients relying on a functioning number.  Hoping we can up the urgency level on this.  If we have problems now, I can?t assume we won?t have problems when we actually hit the switch so I need to get this project completed this week.

We've received the documents to port 6 local and 3 toll-free numbers from DialogTech to Convirza. I'm reaching out to confirm the numbers we are porting, confirm the setup, and obtain your most recent copy of your bill with DialogTech. 

In order to submit the request to our carriers, in addition to the LOA and Port Order Form we've received, we would also like the most recent copy of your bill from DialogTech.  This bill serves as proof of your ability to port these numbers and will allow us to verify the billing address. 

As for the numbers we are porting, I show 6 local numbers and 3 toll-free numbers that we will be porting. Is that correct? 

For the setup, all 6 of the local numbers will be going to a voicemail service. We'll need to coordinate the message on that service shortly. 
Would you like the 3 toll-free  numbers to go to a voicemail service as well? Or will be routing those to another number?

Once we receive the bill I will submit the request to our carriers (Convirza), who will submit the port request and documentation to the losing carrier (DialogTech).  The losing carrier has 3-5 days to respond to the request. We'll keep you updated every few days as we receive updates from the carrier.",,,Re: Fwd: Convirza,,support@convirza.com,support@convirza.com,matt@sceptermarketing.com,gcampbell@convirza.com,,FALSE,FALSE,3,9/14/2016 2:31:53 PM,FALSE,,TRUE,,,FALSE,500j000000IQyFuAAL

I hope this email finds you well. We are reviewing and updating our call system and I had a quick question in regards to the phone menu. When a caller uses one of our 800 numbers they are prompted with the ability to press 1 for new customers and 2 for existing. Can you tell me where this data goes and if it's necessary to have?


Thank you for your help.

Dear Valued Customer, 
 
 Intermedia has developed its brand as a pioneer in delivering secure, reliable, and highly supported cloud business applications. Today marks a new chapter for Intermedia as we announce that the company is being acquired by Madison Dearborn Partners <http://info.intermedia.net/j05T0o22V00hW0ixSch0s00> (?MDP?), a leading private equity firm, with approximately $23 billion in 
assets. MDP will partner with Intermedia as we continue to grow our business cloud platform. 
 
 Today?s press release can be found here <http://info.intermedia.net/L0h2ST00o0is0V6Wi020c0x>. 
 
 Since May 2011, when we were acquired by Oak Hill Capital Partners <http://info.intermedia.net/z00W2c2000hTxjsoVi70S00>, Intermedia has more than tripled revenues (to $200M), 
operating profits (EBITDA), users and product offerings. We?ve also experienced dramatic growth in our customer and partner base, having the privilege to serve 1,000,000+ users worldwide at 75,000+ businesses with 6,000+ active partners. We?ve built a terrific team, including recent CFO <http://info.intermedia.net/O0s0ih0S0200xV2k080coWT> and SVP of Worldwide Sales <http://info.intermedia.net/i9sV0xToil200c000W02S0h> additions from Dropbox? and Microsoft?, respectively. 
 
 With 720+ employees worldwide, we?ve developed a core technology platform, HostPilot?, with 30+ integrated Office in the Cloud? applications ? all with the aim of building a customer-first organization. More specifically, we have: 




	- created a brand new division <http://info.intermedia.net/b0000cT2sVm0Sioa0200Whx> focused on 
cloud and mobile security products, including Advanced Email Security (AES), <http://info.intermedia.net/Mx0S000WVshoc00b20iT0n2> AppID? identity and access 
management, email continuity, and a wide range of others;

	- made further investments in proprietary technologies such as SecuriSync? <http://info.intermedia.net/v0hW0xso0c2SVicoT020000>, a highly secure, easy-to-use, 
enterprise-grade 2-in-1 backup and file sharing solution;

	- expanded product offerings, including:









	- Cloud voice <http://info.intermedia.net/tcSi200sVW02d00xTh000op> and unified communication services,
	- Cloud Microsoft? Exchange,
	- Office 365? productivity applications,
	- And other applications <http://info.intermedia.net/tcSi200sVW02e00xTh000oq> including archiving, encryption and more.






 It?s been quite a transformative five years. Intermedia is now a leading cloud business applications provider, the world?s largest independent provider of cloud-based Exchange email, and a leading phone system provider ? and we?re just getting started!  
 
  With Oak  Hill  we?ve built an incredibly strong foundation. Our partnership with MDP will further accelerate company growth through increased investment in our Worry-Free support experience <http://info.intermedia.net/p0h00V0ofS000rxTc20iWs2>, new and existing products, channel partner programs, 
vertical industry solutions, and additional acquisitions. We are set for even bigger things to come as we tackle this $20+ billion market together.  
 
  Thank you for being an Intermedia customer. We appreciate the opportunity to support your business success.

Glad you were able to get what you needed.

If you would still like tracking for the number you've purchased elsewhere you can port that number to Convirza for a one-time port cost of $15. Your regular contracted number and minutes charges would apply to ported numbers, rather than the premium I quoted for a leased vanity. 

Let us know if you'd like the tracking and I would be happy to send over the porting documents.",,,Re: Vanity Request,,support@convirza.desk-mail.com,support@convirza.desk-mail.com,apexdentalmarketing1@gmail.com,,,FALSE,FALSE,3,9/14/2016 5:52:58 PM,FALSE,,TRUE,,,FALSE,500j000000IRCUXAA5

When a call comes into a toll free number, the owner of the toll free number is responsible for paying the cost of the call. In a regular calling scenario, when a call is coming in from a non-toll free number to a toll free number, the billing is very easy to determine. However, when there are multiple toll free numbers in the call chain, each party tries to pass off the cost to the other party, and often toll free providers avoid this hassle by rejecting calls from other toll free numbers.

This behavior is inherent to the toll free phone number system and is not a specific to calls made with Convirza toll free numbers. Regretfully, Convirza is not able to guarantee all toll-free to toll-free calls will complete successfully.  We recommend having Convirza toll free numbers forward to regular long code numbers in order to receive all incoming calls.",,,Re: Priority - New Media - 8663363344,,telecom@convirza.com,telecom@convirza.com,wricks@convirza.com,,,FALSE,FALSE,3,9/14/2016 6:25:05 PM,FALSE,,TRUE,,,FALSE,500j000000IRHZXAA5

I can answer this question for you.

The feature you are referring to is call Call Shield. It has been designed to prevent spam and telemarketers from ringing through. Most auto-dialer systems used by spammers and telemarketers will hit that menu and disconnect because the auto system will not get through. However when a legitimate caller hits that menu they will press one of the options to get through to you.  The feature can be disabled at your request. Please let us know if you would like it disabled and we can send out the form to do so.

I can help you out with that. I'll look at the source of the numbers to see what we can do.

Spam and robo calls are problematic and plague anyone with a telephone. They become more noticeable when using call tracking because you have more numbers they can hit and the information is readily available. We have a few options to help you out. 

If spammers are commonly using the same phone number we can block it. This is a reactive approach to preventing future calls. I'll look for patterns to see if we can add numbers to your blacklist. I'll let you know whats been found after a full account review. 

We also have a couple proactive approaches to preventing these calls. You can use IVR routing to prevent unwanted calls. Auto-dialers will hit an IVR and won't get through because it requires a manual entry.

We also have a feature called Spam Guard that will help. Spam Guard will automatically run every caller ID from the calls that come into Convirza's system against a database of known spam numbers. If we find a match we will not connect that call. You are able to pick the risk level you are willing to accept. Based on your current plan we can add Spam Guard to every tracking number in your entire account for $59.00 per month. 

I will look for numbers we can block. Please let me know if you'd like more information or if you would like to move forward with an IVR or Spam Guard.",,,Re: Robo Calls,,support@convirza.desk-mail.com,support@convirza.desk-mail.com,lindsey@goodears.net,,,FALSE,FALSE,3,9/14/2016 8:30:49 PM,FALSE,,TRUE,,,FALSE,500j000000IRJw4AAH

complete, please let us know so we can assist in testing and then
deactivate your numbers in our account. This will keep you from getting

Hi David,



Please find attached completed LOA. This will need to be submitted to your
gaining carrier. Once they are able to provide the date which the port will
complete, please let us know so we can assist in testing and then
deactivate your numbers in our account. This will keep you from getting
charged from two different accounts.



Let us know if there are any additional questions.



Thank you,

We recognize that today's venue wasn't the most convenient for handling and
keeping track of the paperwork that we distributed. Thank you all for
helping to keep that as organized as possible.

Please remember to get the signed copies back to Kazy. He will make sure
that we have all the pages back from you, will get them signed by Jeremiah,
and will get you a copy back for your records. We already received a few of
these back. Kazy will go through them tomorrow and make sure that we have
everything we need.

We are aware that a few of you ended up with some spelling issues. Please
contact me and Kazy with the correct spelling that should appear on your
documents and we will get everything updated and a clean new copy issued to
you.

We are aware that there were a couple of you with the wrong dates and
related issues that we need deal with. Please contact me, Kazy, and
Jeremiah and we will work together to make sure that those get taken care
of as well.

Thanks, please let me know if there are any questions.

Thank you for reaching out regarding an issue you've encountered with calls being attributed to the incorrect groups. I've conducted a full audit of the reported issue. My results are provided below.

On Wednesday July 6, 2016 Convirza experienced an internal error that unintentionally reassigned 5 of TAP Publishing's toll-free tracking numbers to the main TAP Publishing group. The five toll-free tracking numbers that were affected by this internal error are: 888-470-3353, 888-638-2606, 888-928-4557, 888-928-7959, and 888-960-7042. 

The issue was discovered on Monday August 8, 2016. Once discovered Convirza immediately began correcting the error by reassigning the routes back to the originally assigned groups before the internal issue. This effort was completed on Wednesday August 10, 2016. Between July 6 and August 10 a total of 32 calls placed to the 5 listed toll-free tracking numbers that were affected by the issue. Due to the impact that this internal error has had on TAP Publishing, Convirza is able to offer a $480 credit (32 calls x $15.00 per call). 

The rest of calls being associated to the unintended group are a result of the way the tracking numbers were provisioned. When a tracking number is provisioned there are 2 group assignments made. The first group assignment determines the group that the tracking number is associated to and searched for on the Manage Numbers Setup Page. The second group assignment is associated to the ring-to number(s) and will determine the group that the call details will be associated to and appear on the Track, Listen, and Reports pages. 

In this case the first group assignment was made to the respective and intended groups but the ring-to groups were assigned to TAP Publishing. Because the cause for the calls being associated to the unintended group was the way these routes were setup, Convirza will not be able to offer a credit for these calls. We will offer support to correct and prevent these types of issues in the future. When requested Convirza can provide provisioning training. We can also complete a full audit to ensure the assigned and ring-to groups are set to the same group. We can also move any call details for the past 6 months to their intended groups. Please let us know if you would like any of the above assistance. 

Thank you for your continued business. We look forward to continuing to work with you to grow your business.",,,Re: Incorrect Grouping of numbers,,support@convirza.com,support@convirza.com,hscarbrough@tapindustrial.com,,,FALSE,FALSE,3,9/16/2016 4:39:47 PM,FALSE,,TRUE,,,FALSE,500j000000HmSh9AAF

We will not be able to play your current message only once. However, there are a number of alternative options for you:

1) Press 2 to forward to customer service (rather than telling them the number)
2) press 2 to hangup (will hangup in less than 30 seconds if the customer chooses 2 before then)

You might want to upload a message that is less than 10 seconds, so that playing 3 times, plus the initial ring and final goodbye, comes to less than 30 seconds total. It may have to be a message that is substantially below 10 seconds and just says something like ""press 1 if you are a new customer or 2 if you are an existing customer,"" and 2 will either hangup or go to customer service.",,,Convirza Message,,support@convirza.desk-mail.com,support@convirza.desk-mail.com,joshweaver9@gmail.com,,,FALSE,FALSE,3,9/16/2016 4:52:44 PM,FALSE,,TRUE,,,FALSE,500j000000Iy5NGAAZ

Mark Krish of  Coit Louisville is in the process of porting his numbers in.
He really needs them in by 9/30 if possible. I believe Chase may have
already submitted this case and we may have his invoice info already, I'm
not sure. Do you have that? Please see documents attached and let me know
if you need anything.

'Save on Everything' from Calltrack wants more 616 grand rapids numbers to
be available for provisioning in the future. Can you guys just add numbers
to that pool? It wouldn't be for a specific campaign, but just hanging out
in the call loop or resporg or whatever for calltrack. So, Callsource
wouldn't be needed I guess to put it into a campaign?

We never received these tickets.  Erica forwarded them inline which keeps all communication in desk within this ticket.  Please have her create a new ticket for support with the numbers attached so they can remove them from the app.  

I tested this a few minutes ago and it doesn't open a new ticket for support.  So even though this was sent to support it didn't appear in our inbox and we never saw it.

Thank you for reaching out to Support while I was away from the office.
To update the extension routing we will need a new greeting recording.

If you want to expedite  this request, you can forward your own recording.
You can download the free WavePad Sound Editor from www.nch.com.au . Each
recording should be saved as 8000Khz 16 Bit Mono.  Send the audio file and
we will upload to the account and edit the extension.


If you want our team to record the whisper send us the new script and we
will record for you.   I look forward to hearing back from you.

Thanks for getting back. I reviewed the document but still do not how to
solve the issue. The documentation says:

*Setting Up Single Phone Numbers (not Session-DNI) *
1. Enter Area Code
2. Select ?Single Number?
3. Select tracking number.
4. Name the tracking number, select Ad Source, specify a call value and
repeat interval.
5. Select what you want to happen when a customer calls this number. This
is what determines what call flow type it will be.

Number 4 on the list is blank. There is nothing to choose. Because of this

I tried calling you to walk you through the phone. I'll do my best to answer below, if there are still any questions please give me a call or lets setup a walk through next week.
I see in the system that you've created your first campaign however as you mentioned, you have not setup any numbers yet. You will find the ""Set up Numbers"" section in pages 7-8 of the quick start guide. It will give you the different options as far setting up the number and then the different routing options available, call action, etc and it will show you the navigation windows.

Basically, if you go to the campaign setup, below you will see the section ""Phone Numbers"" in a blue bar, there you will 2 buttons below ""Add Phone Number"" and ""Add Multiple Phone Numbers"". . Adding Multiple Phone Numbers allows you to configure multiple simple routes at once. For more complex routes, click ?Add Phone Number"". From here you will open the ""Call Flow"" which will be the setup of the number required.

We are happy to setup a walk-through of the system with you next week. Please let us know what works best for you!

Thanks!

To specifically to answer your question about what you read in the quick start guide about number 4, please see below:

-First you will set it to active, then In the field under Single number you will type either the area code or city for the number you want. Once you do that the drop down under ""Tracking Number"" will populate with the options available. Then you will name your call flow, this could be ""Print Advertising"" or any name you want. and then you will continue to select Ad Source from the drop down, Call Value can be left blank and the repeat interval is what defines the time for the system to consider a call new or repeated, you can leave the default that is 72hrs. After this you will choose the routing type, for a simple routing you can select  ""forward to phone number"" and then you will enter the ""Ring to phone number"" desired in the blank field. and then Save! And now you should have a new number setup.

Again, I can walk through this process over the phone and I will be able to answer any other questions.

We started this process back in August and with you no longer supporting the numbers at the end of September I am concerned since our September / October magazine will still be using these numbers.  If these numbers will not be active then I will have over $60,000 in refunds that will be owed to my advertisers.  Is there anything you can do to speed up this process.

For example can you find us a tracking number that can spell out ""Newport""?

If so what is the cost?

Thanks,
Christian

209,213,310,323,408,415,424,442,510,530,559,562,619,626,628,650,657,661,669,707,714,747,760,805,818,831,858,909,916,925,949,951

I can add additional area codes or remove the restrictions if that would assist?",,,Re: 866-375-0507 ISSUE,,support@convirza.desk-mail.com,support@convirza.desk-mail.com,,support@convirza.com,,FALSE,FALSE,3,9/19/2016 2:52:48 PM,FALSE,,TRUE,,,FALSE,500j000000JBhhwAAD

Was there any kind of update that would have triggered our regional managers to receive dozens of emails regarding calls that need their attention?  This kind of information would often be drive to store managers.

However, the calls that our regional managers claimed they listened to were most often basic payment or customer service calls.  I feel that listening to those basic calls stole their time from other equally productive tasks.

Looking for some help on this.  We appreciate you!!!

Tamar:

What are your thoughts about removing the are code restrictions and allow
all area codes to dial in.  We can monitor calls this week and study the
traffic to see if in fact you do need to block some area codes.

The CallShield feature on this number blocks calls that have a certain
tonnage associated with spam calls that are made by computers and or at
times cell phones when callers use their speaker phone.  You do have the
option to remove CallShield *but we do not recommend it*.  I'm attaching a
waiver to remove CallShield in the event you want to test this as well.


I also see that you currently have the number ringing to 818-530-2266 from
12 am to end of day, all days.
Is this correct?

Let me know when you are available for a call so we can discuss further.
I'll be away from my desk from 8:00 AM to 8:30 AM, I will be on the lookout
for your response.   Thank you.

Good to hear from you, but sorry it is with trouble. 

I have a couple of questions to drill into this issue: 
1-Do you have a couple of examples of users receiving the unwanted emails? 
2-Were the regional managers receiving this type of email in the past at any time? 
3-If I understand correctly, Store Managers are set to receive these (and still should) but the new event has extended to another set of users?  

Once I have above information, I will check into the issue and get back to you.",,,Re: Rent One,,support@convirza.com,support@convirza.com,dray@shoprentone.com,,,FALSE,FALSE,3,9/19/2016 7:18:01 PM,FALSE,,TRUE,,,FALSE,500j000000JBqjNAAT

We are experiencing an outage at the datacenter in LA due to the network
provider having a fiber trunk issue. We have fail-over infrastructure in
Atlanta and in St. George (at Tonaquint) that has taken over to handle
processing of our MongoDB master/slave reads/writes. This is directly
affecting the performance CFA & CQM at the moment.

We have our dev ops team working on improving our arbiter instance at
Atlanta and will let you know once we believe this issue is resolved.

How does this affect the customer at this stage? We believe that logging
into either app (CFA & CQM) has a delayed response time. We also believe
that DNI response time could be affected by several seconds.

This is our highest priority at the moment.

Jeff

I am trying to locate a list of Bridgepoint Education active vanity phone numbers.  If possible, could you send me a guide on how to do this.  Currently, I am only able to locate our unused vanity numbers.  Also, could you confirm the number listed for customer care portal is correct?

The following numbers below have gained FOC for 9/20/16. Our dash board is down at the moment. Once it's back up and running, I will put these numbers under the clients reserved ouid. Also just a heads up TN (859) 475-1191 might take longer to receive foc because this number is coming from Verizon. I will keep you posted.

Tracking Number: all of the tracking numbers in all of the pools on the
hear for life website.
Ringto: multiple
Recent Call Example (Date/Time/callfrom and to number): see below
Issue being reported: see below
Testing Done: not yet, see below
Was Issue Able To Be Duplicated: see below
Customer Info: Jessica Beaver
Special instructions: see below

Her customers are experiencing these issues:


   - calls ring and then drop, can't reach us (have to try mult. times) -
   rings a few times and then it seems like no one answers (stops ringing &
   dead air)
      - I tested to see if this too would happen to me & this is what
      happened: it rang a few times, then dead air - turns out our staff did
      answer & she could hear me, but I hung pup because I thought that no one
      was there.
      - call doesn't connect (doesn't ring) - call is dropped immediately
   - I too tested this complaint, and it happened to me as well.


presumably you'll want test calls for each number? How should we do this
when it's so many numbers in all of the pools?

Is there a way to run a test over all of the numbers?

thanks

I believe I misunderstood what exactly was occurring when I first received your request.  What was happening was your user was automatically being added to all new campaigns.  I have toggled the setting on your user ""Auto Add to Campaigns"" to ""No"" which means you would need to be manually added to any campaign you wish to view data for.  

Keep this in mind when setting up customers too...an Owner or Manager might want to see all data so setting them up to be auto-added would be a time saver, however you might have a user who only wishes to see one or two campaigns, that use would be better set to not auto add.  

I hope this helps.  I am so sorry it took me this long to realize what you meant!",,,Re: Call Log,,support@convirza.desk-mail.com,support@convirza.desk-mail.com,amanfredi@gannett.com,,,FALSE,FALSE,3,9/20/2016 5:49:17 PM,FALSE,,TRUE,,,FALSE,500j000000Gq01TAAR

Here is the deal. Currently, when someone calls our 855-532-3274 number there are three prompts.

-          Dial 1 for Dealer Support

-          Dial 2 For sales

-          Dial 3 to be connected to a live operator


I need to get rid of the first two prompts and have all calls routed to our dealer support number (313-262-3728).

My question is, if we do not have multiple lines, how do you usually handle the greeting or what are your recommendations?

We may need to add more lines in the near future, but for now, I would like to change the number to ring to one telephone line.

Let me know and thank you.

Last week someone from the client services team sent Stephanie invoices for
Empire Beauty School and updated their payment information.  Could you
please log this in SaleForce, as I was not copied on those e-mails.

This will help so that AMs are not doubling tasks that have already been
completed in the future.

Hello Stephanie,



Thank you for reaching out!  Convirza has taken over billing for your
account as part of the acquisition from CallSource, and it looks like we
have e-mailed June-August's invoices to Michael McCaffrey via the below
address:





mmccaffrey@empire.edu





?I am happy to update our billing contact information for your account to a
different recipient, if needed.  I have attached the June, July, and August
invoices here as well as our W-9.



Please reach out if I can answer any questions.



Thank you!?

Moneymailer on CQM went and grabbed a 858 number from our available
inventory and provisioned it for a dentist, Dr. Sara Naderi. The number
they provisioned, 8583681122 was already provisioned by moneymailer on the
call track side.

Moneymailer on the call track side has had that number for a while and
needs to keep it. They are going to put an ivr on the line so people can
still reach both parties.

They are now very worried about the numbers in our inventory. I talked to
eric and he said to send in a ticket and that there are some more clean up
processes that can be done.

We are going to setup a new route on cqm but the client hasnt said i can
delete the old route yet. I will let you know when i do that.

I listened to all calls received from after your last update yesterday and
this morning. So far there are no calls where the representative can't hear
the customer. There are several short calls with no audio but they appear
to be hang ups, however I will continue to monitor this.

Wagner Equipment on the CallFish server reported that a few callers called
in and during the disclaimer the call was disconnected. This started on
9/20.

moneymailer noticed that group 202-50 in their account didnt have any
numbers listed for their sub-groups. I couldnt find a record of old ones
but was able to have the client send me numbers that they thought should be
active,

Here are some of the numbers:
8582016281
8582016280
7602832099
6193541295
6196182517
8582013018
8583048130
8583681122
8583653238
8583488070
4084654082



All of these numbers had their last activity in CQM during September of
2015. They are all routing correctly but it sounds like they are on the
call track platform. Do we have any record of when or why these numbers
left CQM.

The client is checking to see if they were ported on purpose but they
couldnt find a record so far.

In preparation for today's all-hands meeting I wanted to send out an update
on the execution status of the Sprint 8 plan which is our Aug / Sept,
Dev/QA Plan.

https://docs.google.com/a/convirza.com/spreadsheets/d/1tYaFKVSavy6KqYiDDZOB_uRfNDd3-j1pugW-6fdH6Rc/edit?usp=sharing

Work Items:
1. Scheduled Reports - We decided as a team that the output of the email
attachments and the Call Details Report needed to be refactored to be able
to deliver the right product. This rework has caused us to go over in our
plan as indicated by the red and green lines going past the gray line. See
below. We have an end-to-end demo scheduled for today, then will conduct
further testing, and anticipate a final release mid next week.


?
2. Optimization Features: 1) Speeding up index performance of Webhook_Logs
for CQM Reporting, CQM Scoring, CQM Indicator Report, 2) Refactoring the
Beta Server to update the SSL versions we support to be compliant from a
security vulnerability perspective.

3. Defect Fixes: (The following have been deployed to production already)
Reference the plan or Jira for the details.
CT-8402
CT-13871
CT-12830
CT-12829
CT-13163

CT-12855
CT-13105
CT-13473
CT-13580
CT-7135
CQM-4432

4. Billing Fixes:
CFA Billing fixes, CT-5023 & CT-14140 are ready for production deployment.
CQM Billing fixes, CQM-3828 still needs to be worked on.

5. Routing Features: (Eric can speak these items)

6. SING:
Decoding of Word Based Queries - the engine this do this is near complete.
Danny is testing against some of the basic queries while an end to end demo
is being worked on.
Transcripts in Casandra is being changed to Transcripts in MongoDB. The
schema for the collection is being finalized and has been created in the
Dev environment. We are looking to deploy the collection schema next week.

I am easily managed; just be firm with me.
Those who are great I have made great.
Those who are failures, I have made failures.
I am not a machine, though I work with the precision of a machine and the
intelligence of a person.
You can run me for profit, or you can run me for ruin.

And I will then do it automatically.
I am your servant.

Thank you for your help!

Could you please correct the Addendum J to eliminate the billing address
that was entered as the business address in the bottom part of the form.
You can keep that address blank, as it will not need to be updated (only
the billing address is changing).

Please send the corrected Addendum to Jessie and let him know to sign and
return the updated version.

Thank you!

Sincerely,

Can you provide more detail surrounding 'source based' vs. 'session based'?
Also, did you test all numbers in our account, not just the DNI numbers? I
want to ensure that you're not finding any connectivity issues.

As I mentioned previously, providing times, tracking and originating
numbers is not possible due to my staff not knowing which number was dialed
by our patients, etc. I, however did provide two examples when I tested two
numbers which I provided in my initial email to you.

If you've tested every single numbers in our account and you found no
issues (i.e. when calling each tracking number you were transferred to each
of our clinics smoothly), then, I will ask my staff to try to better
document any complaints as you've requested.

I still feel uneasy about this system. I shouldn't have to be documenting &
testing the performance of these numbers. Please advise regarding the above.

Session based is where you have a pool of numbers for each location rotating out on the web page to track every individual visitor. Source based is where you have a single number for each location and it simply tracks the source of the visitors (like yahoo, google, bing, facebook, etc...).

I only tested the DNI numbers because my understanding was that those were the numbers effected by the issues outlined, but if that is not the case then I can test them all.

It's very unusual to have consistent routing issues like these.

We should be able to get your Google Analytics integration activated within a day or so here. Your sales rep here, Brett, will just have to make a quick amendment and we can get that taken care of without any additional cost to you.

Below is our info and links on GA integration and DNI. Please ask if there are any questions.

What is DNI? 
DNI allows users to display a unique call tracking phone number on a website or webpage based on the visitors session, referring source, or a unique URL.   

Configuration of the DNI service will be completed in two places. First in the Convirza App and then in the HTML code of the website you would like the number to swap on. Coding instructions can be located in Settings - Configuration - DNI in your Convirza account. The instructions provide an example of how the HTML code may work. We recommending using a professional HTML coder to code the site, otherwise you may run into unexpected errors. Convirza may be able to provide professional HTML coding assistance for a nominal fee.   

Attached is a link to our main DNI Tech Brief. If covers the three distinct types of DNI that are offered and provides use cases for each. Session DNI is by far our most popular and most flexible type as it yields the most data used in association with PPC campaigns. 

If you are having issues accessing the attached doc please copy and paste the following url into your web browser: http://www.convirza.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/HIW-DNI3-CFA.pdf


Our DNI service is fully capable in Click-to-Call situations. If you would like to view our click to call implementation supplement please copy and paste the following URL into your web browser: http://www.clearslide.com/v/upmgc6s3l84lfcp4ectb


We also invite you to look at our Universal Google Analytics integration. We integrate with Universal Google Analytics and post calls as call events. You will be able to tie phone calls to your website activities with this integration. For more information on our integration check out our Google Analytics Integration Tech Brief. You can access that by copying and pasting the following url into your web browser: http://www.convirza.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/HIW-UA-integration-CFA.pdf

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any additional questions on any of these services.

And they all appear to be routing fine. Is it possible that there could be
some systematic problem across their account that causes some number to
only occasionally drop calls? If so, is it possible to do some kind of
group audit on the numbers to see if there is some issue somewhere, even if
there are no example calls to go by?

I've already created 5. You can reference any one of those if you have

get fixed shortly.)

Sending this e-mail to follow-up on your request for more information on our Dynamic Number Insertion (DNI) feature.  This is a very high level overview. We are also attaching and including links to our technical briefs. We highly recommend you review these documents as well. 


What is DNI? 
DNI allows users to display a unique call tracking phone number on a website or webpage based on the visitors session, referring source, or a unique URL.   

Configuration of the DNI service will be completed in two places. First in the Convirza App and then in the HTML code of the website you would like the number to swap on. Coding instructions can be located in Setup - Advanced - Dynamic Number Insertion in your Convirza account. The instructions provide an example of how the HTML code may work. We recommending using a professional HTML coder to code the site, otherwise you may run into unexpected errors. Convirza may be able to provide professional HTML coding assistance for a nominal fee.   

Attached is a link to our main DNI Tech Brief. If covers the three distinct types of DNI that are offered and provides use cases for each. Session DNI is by far our most popular and most flexible type as it yields the most data used in association with PPC campaigns. 

If you are having issues accessing the attached doc please copy and paste the following url into your web browser: http://www.convirza.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/HIW-DNI3-Convirza-twc.pdf

Session based DNI will require a Number Pool to be setup in advance before configuring. You will want to send a request to support@convirza.com with the following information (with examples):

Pool Name: Google PPC Lakeshore Office
Amount of Pool Numbers: 5
Desired Toll Free or Local number Area code and Prefix:  801-647-XXXX

Our DNI service is fully capable in Click-to-Call situations. If you would like to view our click to call implementation supplement please copy and paste the following URL into your web browser: http://www.clearslide.com/v/upmgc6s3l84lfcp4ectb


We have a couple of additional features that greatly supplement our DNI service. We invite you to look at the following: 

- Our Google Analytics integration. We integrate with Universal Google Analytics and post calls as call events. You will be able to tie phone calls to your website activities with this integration. For more information on our integration check out our Google Analytics Integration Tech Brief. You can access that by copying and pasting the following url into your web browser: http://www.convirza.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/HIW-GA-Integration-twc.pdf

- Conversation Analytics is a powerful feature that will give you greater insight into the outcomes of your telephone calls. These outcomes can be tied back to your marketing efforts to more effectively optimize your campaigns. For a quick minute long demonstration of this service please visit our demonstration video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzhjIiWgdSY&feature=youtu.be

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any additional questions on any of these services.

I re-saved the route and experienced same problem.

**Note, this was associated with their dni on www.jotires.ca, so I set up

I have completed calling each number on your account, and all of my test calls went through.  I have submitted the number: 6479550881 to our telecom team to troubleshoot, and I will keep you posted on what we find. 

As we noted on the call, I added a new tracking number (647-499-3955) swapped out the website DNI setting (so it is now displaying on your website,) and labeled the route the same way as the original number (Direct or Other) so you can pull reporting with the two numbers easily.  

I will let you know as soon as I hear something!",,,Follow up on Numbers,,support@convirza.desk-mail.com,support@convirza.desk-mail.com,jotiresinfo@gmail.com; info@jotires.ca; joe@jotires.ca,,,FALSE,FALSE,3,9/22/2016 9:11:45 PM,FALSE,,TRUE,,,FALSE,500j000000JEAGwAAP

Thanks for giving me a call.  Please let me know if you find more details on 888-789-6102, or if you found the issue.  

I have attached the report which lists all numbers and shows when they will expire.  After discussing with my colleague, I would recommend going into the campaigns (i.e. ""Edit Campaign"" from the provisioning page) and changing the End Date.

The system should allow you to set for up to 6 more years for those you do not want to expire.  This prevents having to ""end"" campaign and lose service for any amount of time.  The other ways to do this do require number out of service for a short time.

We continue to monitor this situation.  Please note that the caller
identified on call index # 40848 is calling from a cell phone, and cell
phones can have different reception depending where they are situated when
calling.  We have identified two calls coming in from this caller and it
appears that the call placed at 8:41 AM lasted 17 seconds and that there is
some kind of interference on the caller's side.

Since this is a call from a cell phone our Engineering team can't use it as
a sample call, but please keep me informed if the the issue persists and
continue to send me samples so we can do our research on our end.   Thank
you.

2) When it comes to provisioning numbers for any given area code, say 905, you may need to test a number of rate centers (the locations listed) before you find one with available tracking numbers. If none show as available, click more, wait a moment, and then reopen the dropdown to see if any have been populated there (those are direct from the carrier rather than from our inventory, but either way the effect/cost is the same for you). If none are available even then, you can contact us and request numbers for a specific area code and prefix.
3) You can also use this tool:
http://www.localcallingguide.com/lca_rcdist.php
to determine if calls between any two area code/prefix combinations (the first 6 numbers of a full phone number) are local to one another. Simply enter in the area code and prefix in the given fields.",,,Re: Dynamic Number Insertion From Convirza for Advertisers,,support@convirza.desk-mail.com,support@convirza.desk-mail.com,eryk.gabriel@reachdigital.ca; bin.tang@reachdigital.ca; dan@reachdigital.ca,,,FALSE,FALSE,3,9/22/2016 10:33:42 PM,FALSE,,TRUE,,,FALSE,500j000000JE28eAAD

My name is Gabriel and I am your new account manager here at Convirza. I'd like to schedule a time soon for us to go over your account, and how to make the most of the application.

Let me know what times you are available and I can schedule something. I am available most any time 8am-5pm MST, M-F.

I understand that you are looking to use session level Dynamic Number Insertion (DNI), as well as Google Analytics Integration. Please see below for links and attachments to our documentation concerning setting that up.


What is DNI? 
DNI allows users to display a unique call tracking phone number on a website or webpage based on the visitors session, referring source, or a unique URL.   

Configuration of the DNI service will be completed in two places. First in the Convirza App and then in the HTML code of the website you would like the number to swap on. Coding instructions can be located in Settings - Configuration - DNI in your Convirza account. The instructions provide an example of how the HTML code may work. We recommending using a professional HTML coder to code the site, otherwise you may run into unexpected errors. Convirza may be able to provide professional HTML coding assistance for a nominal fee.   

Attached is a link to our main DNI Tech Brief. If covers the three distinct types of DNI that are offered and provides use cases for each. Session DNI is by far our most popular and most flexible type as it yields the most data used in association with PPC campaigns. 

If you are having issues accessing the attached doc please copy and paste the following url into your web browser: http://www.convirza.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/HIW-DNI3-CFA.pdf


Our DNI service is fully capable in Click-to-Call situations. If you would like to view our click to call implementation supplement please copy and paste the following URL into your web browser: http://www.clearslide.com/v/upmgc6s3l84lfcp4ectb


We also invite you to look at our Universal Google Analytics integration. We integrate with Universal Google Analytics and post calls as call events. You will be able to tie phone calls to your website activities with this integration. For more information on our integration check out our Google Analytics Integration Tech Brief. You can access that by copying and pasting the following url into your web browser: http://www.convirza.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/HIW-UA-integration-CFA.pdf

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any additional questions on any of these services.

Krystina,

The minutes on any of the vanity numbers that begin or end with ?CHILL?
would be $0.07 per minute.

Would you like me to go ahead and order any of those for you?

*JP* emailed:

Krystina,

Any of the numbers that begin or end with ?CHILL? would be leased for $20 a
month.

Our premium vanity partners set their own prices so costs for those would
be on an individual basis, so I?d have to check availability and cost on an
individual basis.

We may be able to use one of these. What is the cost?

*JP* emailed:

Krystina,

I found several that end with ?chill? and two that start with ?chill?
(888-CHILL34, 866-CHILL73). Would those work for you? The rest of the
options were too limited. I could check with out premium vanity partners.
They usually charge a bit more. Would you like me to check there as well?

Would you like me to start the process on any of the ?chill? ones that are
available? Or check with our premium vanity partners to see if they have
anything with CBAYNOW, CHILLOUT, or CHILLIN?

I can work to get them ordered. I?ll still have Marty work with you on the
pricing and vanity agreement.

Yes, as long as they are toll free. We?re open to other options.

SEP 13, 2016  |  01:49PM MDT
*JP* emailed:

Krystina,

I can check the availability of those numbers for you.

Do they have to be 800 vanities? Or can I look for the same things for the
other toll-free area codes? Opening up the search to the other toll-free
area codes will increase the likelihood of finding a match, and may reduce
the cost of the vanity as well.

I will take care of that last pool that didn't have enough numbers.

In the future, when you get an error for not enough numbers for a certain
rate center, you can check the surrounding rate centers. To do so google
the area code to find the city, then map it to find all the surrounding
cities. The local rate center is Richmond Hill, Canada. (See below.) In
this case I will check Markham, Vaughan, Toronto, Mississauga, and
Brampton.

Yes I did receive the email with the credit you are offering. I apologize
for the delay in getting back to you. Our team has been spread thin here
for the past few weeks and we just met this morning to discuss the
situation.

As for the numbers being provisioned incorrectly, I do not agree with your
assessment. The incorrect setup for the groups was in the IVR settings
which is handled by Convirza. We have been using the same procedure to
provision numbers before and after the time frame in which these numbers
were set up (after further review here the incorrect numbers seem to be
between April 7 and May 14).

We were told for the IVR to be set up and used on our account we would have
to email support after the number was provisioned and they would apply the
IVR settings. The problem seems to be someone in the support department
during that time frame setting them up incorrectly.

Since the problem was found a few weeks ago we have been double checking
the IVR setting when they are returned and found another error that was
made in the past few days. We provisioned a number last Thursday and when
checking the IVR settings this morning found one option set for the correct
group and the other option tied to a totally different group. As you can
imagine errors like these can't be tolerated in regards to our business
model.

We would like to set up a conference call sometime later this week if
possible to discuss errors that have been made and details on how we can
eliminate these going forward. We would also like to hear from Convirza
where the progress is on combining the companies you control. We also have
an account with the previous CallSource platform that we have not had
problems such as these with. They also seem to have a process of
provisioning with IVR that is a lot easier.

Please give me some times that would be good for your team to jump on a
conference call.

Thank you,

Thanks for giving us a call today.  As we discussed, we investigated why our subscription is being declined, where other vendor subscriptions go through.  You pointed out this is a repeat issue, and the card was declined a few months ago. 

You provided a new card for today's charges ($469.58) which we have deleted after it went through.  After looking closer, I noticed we had an old address for the card which was on file - card ending in 0932 - and have updated the address: 

3566 Beverly Glen Blvd
Sherman Oaks, CA 91423

I have set this card back to the primary payment method, and we will wait until next month to see if it went through.

Hello Jeremiah from Barb Rolfe at Fountain Tire in Edmonton Alberta. I know it has been a long time.

We are exploring the world of On-Line Chat for our Customer Service team. I'm looking for some ideas and contacts around providing training for this team on how to manage and work with customer via On-Line Chat. And I thought of you. Had to work a bit to track you down, but as you know, research is one of my strongest traits.

When this makes its way to you, please reach out. I'd be interested in knowing if you have ideas or contacts on providing training for an On-Line Chat Team.

Thanks

As far as eliminating errors like this in the future, Convirza now has an in-house spam blocking feature called SpamGuard that can replace your current IVR ""Press 1 if you are a new customer..."" anti-spam setup. This would avoid any future issues with IVR. I have attached a document that details how SpamGuard works. The cost is $89.00/month for your call volume.

We are willing to offer 6 months of free SpamGuard, and to transition your current spam blocking IVR's to normal simple routes and setup your SpamGuard for you. We can also move over historical call data, from the time and on the numbers where the groups were incorrect, to their correct groups if you want to see those old calls in the correct groups now. 

We will need to consult with one of our managers who will return to the office tomorrow before we can schedule a conference call.

Hi, Josh,



There are two numbers that I?d like to move out of your domain so we can
use them with a new business that we acquired last week.  The numbers are
as follows:



800-799-7811

800-491-5811



How do I start the process of moving them?  Does that start from my side,
your side or from the side of the receiving party?

Thank you very much for your help with this.


Best,


Bob

I wanted to follow up on the email Brian sent on Friday to see if you have any updates for us.
We have been working on this for over 1 month and it does not seem that we have moved forward at all with
the porting of the numbers.
Will you be able to give him all the requested CSR's needed soon.
Your help is greatly appreciated!

   - We will need to cancel routes only for Edmunds by EOD on 9/30.
   - I will also need to have all the data downloaded from the account
   specifically call details and ca data.
   - The download of data will happen after the routes are deleted.
   - Once the data and routes have been completed then we can begin working
   on the users and groups.
   - We will be just deleting all user and groups but not closing the
   account completely.
   - We will leave the parent group and the user Michael Curtis -
   mcurtis@edmunds.com
   - User can and groups can be deleted on 10/03

Sending this e-mail to follow-up on your request for more information on our Dynamic Number Insertion (DNI) feature. Please note the link to our Google Analytics Integration below as well. This is a very high level overview. We are also attaching and including links to our technical briefs. We highly recommend you review these documents as well. 


What is DNI? 
DNI allows users to display a unique call tracking phone number on a website or webpage based on the visitors session, referring source, or a unique URL.   

Configuration of the DNI service will be completed in two places. First in the Convirza App and then in the HTML code of the website you would like the number to swap on. Coding instructions can be located in Settings - Configuration - DNI in your Convirza account. The instructions provide an example of how the HTML code may work. We recommending using a professional HTML coder to code the site, otherwise you may run into unexpected errors. Convirza may be able to provide professional HTML coding assistance for a nominal fee.   

Attached is a link to our main DNI Tech Brief. If covers the three distinct types of DNI that are offered and provides use cases for each. Session DNI is by far our most popular and most flexible type as it yields the most data used in association with PPC campaigns. 

If you are having issues accessing the attached doc please copy and paste the following url into your web browser: http://www.convirza.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/HIW-DNI3-CFA.pdf


Our DNI service is fully capable in Click-to-Call situations. If you would like to view our click to call implementation supplement please copy and paste the following URL into your web browser: http://www.clearslide.com/v/upmgc6s3l84lfcp4ectb


We also invite you to look at our Universal Google Analytics integration. We integrate with Universal Google Analytics and post calls as call events. You will be able to tie phone calls to your website activities with this integration. For more information on our integration check out our Google Analytics Integration Tech Brief. You can access that by copying and pasting the following url into your web browser: http://www.convirza.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/HIW-UA-integration-CFA.pdf

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any additional questions on any of these services.

Could you get back to me on this.   I need to have Telecom's authorization
to have CallSource move this number back to Hub 1002 so I can recover the
number into client's account.   Tracking number (702) 560-6114 is now in
Hub 1096 Contact Point (do not use- no CallLoop).   I look foward to
hearing back from you.   Thank you.

As you are aware we are unable to rename the campaigns so I have attached
the excel sheet which shows the changes we want.

 

Column A shows the group in which the account is under.

 

Column B shows the CURRENT campaign name.

 

Column C shows what we want the campaign to be changed to.

 

If you have any questions please call me at 415-859-1911

 

Let us know when these changes have been done.

Have a look at the attached calls for Critical Power.  

 

We were told that all the numbers in our pool belong only to us.

 

But you can see all the calls in red that came through in which it was a
WRONG number.

 

Also we noted that any calls coming from our BING PPC campaign, the caller
cannot hear the client on the other line.

 

There is probably like 10 of these calls that happened , and the only thing
they have in common is that they all came from our BING PPC and the callers
are all from a 559 area code (Fresno)

 

Not sure if that helps troubleshoot but do you know why that may be?

Your request sounded like you needed a finalized answer to proceed on your side, and right now that rejection is the only real answer I can give you.

Maybe you can go back to the client and get them proceeding to the point where it?ll give me the response I need to help you help them.

You contacted us to ask if we could make tracking numbers ring differently.  

Both Chase and I looked into the feature or function, and ""distinctive ring"" must be configured on the answering side.  Usually this is accomplished with different phone numbers or DIDs, having different rings associated with unique inbound paths.   This feature is not available on all phone types and carriers.  If the site does have this feature set up, we would ""access"" by pointing the tracking number to the phone number with the unique ring.

I have looked into your request - Setting up a webhook to only trigger when customer selects ""Sales"" when choosing between Sales, Service and Parts.  

The possible solution will depend on how the payload is handled on your end.  We could set up an IVR as discussed on the call, where the calls would be grouped by which selection the caller makes: 1 group for Sales, 2 for Service, and 3 for Parts.  

Part of the webhook payload data is ""Group Name. "" If we did set it up this way, is it possible to only update CRM when ""Group Name = Sales"" ? (or when Group Organizational Unit = specific number?)  

If this is unfeasible, I believe other possible solutions might be designed using API.  Let me know what you think.   I have also copied Blake Tingey on this request, who is your account manager.

Store Managers could receive it but we would need to get it figured out so they aren?t getting blasted too heavily.  A lot of calls picked up by CA are payments or customer service questions that they are addressing.  It frustrates them and we already task them to listen to calls daily (even though they don?t do it!).

Per our discussion I have attached a paper on our SpamGuard.   I know you were hoping to get it for free but the implementation of this feature as well as the maintenance of the system does cost Convirza man hours and maintenance as well.   This is a great feature though and I know it will benefit you by eliminating  the frustrations you expressed to me on our call. 


My suggestion is to give it a try after one month we can send you a report to show it's effectiveness . Based on your call volume I can get you setup on it for $59.00/month.  Can I get you setup on this?

Taylor,

To set up the call tracking we need this to be as seamless as possible for
our client. As I mentioned, we are using Google Tag manager so we do not
have to go back in forth with their website guy (their family friend) to
input code.

After we input our code from tag manager onto their site, will we need any
further setup with them, or can your company and ours work everything else
out from Tag Manager?

Could you ask your boss who mentioned he is familiar with Tag Manager to
advise?

Is there some kind of documentation on porting laws that I could give her?

We will of course approve the port out request.  Are they just talking
about toll free numbers?  I've txted their millennial director of marketing
(his voice mail is full) asking him WTF?

10 days ago I and Convirza dropped everything on a weekend to rectify a
problem that has nothing to do with us and you don't have the courtesy to
call, txt or e-mail a supplier of 8 years?

He has no class.  Must have been raised in California.  They are the rudest
MFkrs in the USA.

Additionally, Company must be current with all funds due and payable to WWT, related to this agreement, prior to the release of any numbers by the RespOrg.

The 888-610-3214 is still pointing to our TriMark phone number.

We do not want this number that does not belong to us pointing to our number.

My understanding was that you were going to contact reach local, and get permission to turn off the forwarding.

Can you advise when this can be completed?

I spoke with Jeff about this number.  This number was set to end in March, but was the only number set to expire before 2023.  
He has been running a TV add for a month (?) or two before someone said there was an issue with the number.  (The number had been moved to misdial account.)  He had a couple of questions I was not able to answer:  Can we see who set end date (I think he was worried former advertiser might have ended the campaign?) Or if there are auto-alerts about campaigns ending?  I haven't suggested anything yet - like setting to autorenew - but he was concerned about running into this issue again.  

He also mentioned he doesn't remember seeing invoices recently.  Can you validate they were sent?  or tell me how?   Let me know how I can assist or advise Jeff or if you are reaching out directly.

We are working on growing and accelerating our marketing efforts and
properly tracking all of our Convirza efforts.

Most if not all of you have access to and use the Convirza marketing CFA
account for demos with customers and opportunities.
You should each have your own Group/sub-Group with your name.  Please only
use this Group for creating demo or test sub-groups, campaigns, call flows,
etc.

Please DO NOT create anything directly under the ""Convirza Live"" Group.
This group is for our internal Convirza marketing.  We are constantly
cleaning it up as people are creating new test campaigns and call flows
here.  Also, any calls you place in this Convirza Live group will skew our
marketing numbers.  We must keep this data clean so we can properly
optimize our marketing and properly evaluate performance.

Let me know if you don't have your own Group or need help with getting set
up with your own Group.

Thanks,

Those numbers are still pending. However TN (336) 434-5643, I am still
being told that their current service provider has indicated that their
account is not active.Your customer should contact their current provider
and update their account.Once complete please update your order with a new
port request date.


The problem is the number is incorrect. As I have been restating, the
number is ""Archdale #8  336-434-5649  acct#: 039866801"" the number ends in
5649 and not 5643 I assume that is why it is showing up as inactive.

After talking with our telecom department the process we take before putting a number in our inventory is scrubbing the number for 90 days or if there has been no calls in a 30 day period. Scrubbing is when we take a number and monitor it and make sure that there are no calls. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Update-

This is directly from my telecom representative: 

""Okay so I just got off the phone with my carrier. They would like CSRs for all the porting numbers because they don't have the BTN (Billing Telephone Number)for the porting numbers showing and they think some of the numbers are on sub accounts which might have different information with certain numbers. This is why I was hitting road blocks with the previous carrier. So Intermedia just explained to me what they were seeing. She said they can work with the new LOA I sent you so if they just make sure to fill it out correctly, they might be able to work with that..""

Here's the take home. 
-We're trying to port these numbers in using a different gaining carrier now. This is why I sent the new  Intermedia LOA on a prior e-mail.  Please complete this with the correct information. 
-We need individual CSR's for all sub accounts. 
-We also need The Billing Telephone Number (BTN)  for each group as well.  If they are all the same great. 

Allyson,  can you assists with these items?",,,Re: Convirza Local Port Information,,support@convirza.desk-mail.com,support@convirza.desk-mail.com,annprgm@aol.com; Allyson.Hudson@realpage.com,,,FALSE,FALSE,3,9/29/2016 10:18:46 PM,FALSE,,TRUE,,,FALSE,500j000000Gqg4EAAR

Could you please make an update on the following in CFA? See attached. I
highlighted the row to update. The DNI class attributes were placeholders.
We now have the final attributes.

The best page to edit these will be under Settings, Customization, and DNI.
Be sure to have Homewatch CareGivers selected in the breadcrumb. See
screenshot below. That page will be much quicker than editing each campaign
and call flow.

You might be able to engage your phone vendor for the 5623311230 line to add it there.

Hi Brian,

I have submitted all of this information back to our carrier regarding the port.

Can you please remind me, what numbers are missing from the port? I will submit for a new LOA on these or have you added them to the existing port request?

Thank you,

Please order and reserve enough local 905 Richmond Hill, ON Canada numbers

I also checked the closest rate center, Brampton. Plenty of numbers are
appearing for single provisioning, but I keep getting an error when trying
to provision a pool. Is there a known defect around this?

Parker Hannifin Parflex Division just ported on 9/27 I went in to check to
see why the disclaimer is not playing and the call only rings once then

?(My boyfriend waited on them at Duke's in Malibu).  ?
After they chatted a while
?, Bruce's wife, Laurie,?
? said to give her a call since she heads up marketing: 818.402.2943


I believe they just do service but mentioned an associated dealership that
may also be interested in opening an account....

Thanks!

Hello,



It just came to our attention that a handful of our tracking numbers have
expired over the last several months.  Is there a possibility of
re-enabling these numbers?  If not, I?ll need to know specifically which
numbers are no longer active so we can re-assign them ASAP.

In June my client, LINKS Worldgroup reached out to let me know that the
support team had updated her CC information.

I am not seeing a case or activity logged in SalesForce for this, and Kazy
has no record of a faxed in form).  I do know the CC info was updated, as
payment has been going through since the update (after a rejection in June).

Support team: Could you please check the Desk cases to see if you can
forward me record of this.  I am working with is client on an urgent
discrepancy issue.

Thank you!

Sincerely,

Is there an easy way to figure out how many calls came in via PAID search,
Organic search, Direct etc without manually looking at the call log,
clicking on the INFO button next to the call, and manually counting the
Referring Type?

 

I see there is a way to filter but it does not include Referring Type in the
dropdown so there is no easy way of telling.  Let us know if we are missing
something.

Yeah, it did.  It seemed to resolve itself, but then we were unable to add numbers to the groups.  I was just about to test it again, when Chase gave me a call, as I was adding and it worked correctly.

Thanks for following up sir.

Per our conversation last week, I agreed to review this case and let you know what I find out. I have also deleted the numbers in question per your request so you won't be charged going forward. After reviewing your e-mail I am pretty sure I can deduce what happened.    

Gabriel was correct when he said there were no numbers associated with the Hogan & Sons group which is why he responded the way he did. What was not discussed in your correspondence with him were the subgroups under Hogan & Sons.  It was not clear in the request that the numbers under those subgroups were supposed to be deleted. 

Perhaps we could have asked more questions to find out the particulars of what was wanted but this obviously didn't happen.    

It is important to note that you are actually an administrator and have the ability to do add/edit/delete users, groups, and numbers as well. In fact, we encourage our clients in general to learn how to manage their accounts so they have control over issues like these.  If request are sent to support it is also up to the company admin to check the completed work.  Please let me know if you need training on how to administer the account.  

I've discussed with my management team any possible credits.  As this could have been brought to our attention sooner, we are to willing to give you a credit for the value of carrying the 8 numbers for one month.   $5.99 X 8 = $47.92.  This will be applied to your next billing statement. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.",,,RE: Hogan Cancelling,,support@convirza.desk-mail.com,support@convirza.desk-mail.com,jerryt@keymotive.net,cvanputten@convirza.com,,FALSE,FALSE,3,10-03-2016 15:56,FALSE,,TRUE,,,FALSE,500j000000ChkW5AAJ

Inside calltrack I need the following excel spreadsheet filled out.


   - Please begin with column L,M,N (July, August, Sept) then send the
   report back to me for review
   - I would need the Total Tracking numbers the account currently has in
   column ""B""
   - The rest of the report will be by month YTD, I need to know the amount
   of calls and the total minutes for the month.
   - Column G, K and O will auto fill with a formula
   - Row 62 and 63 will also auto fill


This is a rush and if can not be done within a few hours please let me know.

Hi Audrey,

Well, it's finally here.  I need some of your help.  I need a new
whisper recorded.  In the past, all I've needed to do was email the info
to Shoshana or Nathan, so I'm doing the same for you.  If you need
anything else, please let me know.   Here you go...

We  need the following whisper recorded, in a Female
voice:

Hibu Mobile Ad (Hibu is pronounced ""High-Boo"")
""This is a lead from your Hibu Mobile Ad. Please
repeat your greeting now.""

Please be sure it is placed in the ""Whisper"" and not the ""Consumer
Greeting"" section.  Also, please make sure to name it using an initial
capital letter so that it falls in alphabetical order when uploaded.

Thank you.

reserve it in a TBD campaing that will end at midnight.  Let me know if you
like to keep the number or if I should let it end?   Thank you.

The way to see how many calls came in via Paid search, Organic search,

will show you how they got to the website. I want to make sure that this is

I had initially sent this to telecom but was told i need to have dev do
it??? So i assume i need to have a jira ticket created for it. Let me know
if you need anything else.
I originally sent this in on 9/23 but wasnt told until today that telecom
can't do it. If there is any way to get it rushed that would be very
appreciated.

I am trying to connect the tracking number 336 790 3799 to the phone number
336-253-5100 or to 336-799-0077. Neither works. I called my client and he
said the 336-799-0077 number is a google number. I also tried another
tracking number from you guys 336-790-3791 with the same result.

This is a suspension for now, not a cancellation.  The attached excel doc is used for both.  Using Postman,  only update the tracking number/routes  and the users.    Change the routes to have a 9999999999 terminal number effectively suspending them.    For the users please change their status to inactive.  This will prevent them from accessing the app.

Most of you have heard that level 3 has a major outage affecting the whole
US.

We have successfully routed our outbound calls to a back up carrier. We are
seeing much better service levels. However, this carrier also has level 3
in their outbound dec's so we will continue to see some drops, as well as
there still may be issue's with some Level 3 originated DID's. Also,our
backup carrier does not have the high quality lines that Level 3 does so we
may see a drop in call quality.

We will keep you posted on this outage. Thanks for your patience!

My schedule as well as my telecom person's schedule is pretty open.  When is the earliest your team can discuss? 

Also, new news from my telecom team.

 ""Our carrier tried to pull a CSR and no information was available online from MCI/Verizon. 
So I presume that customer has these numbers on a PRI or similar trunk group with MCI/Verizon. Could you please also ask them what the BTN (Billing Telephone Number)is for all numbers on this list? Per their CSR, the numbers are in two groups so possibly there are two BTNs. Their CSR does not show the BTN.)""",,,Re: Convirza Local Port Information,,support@convirza.desk-mail.com,support@convirza.desk-mail.com,annprgm@aol.com; Allyson.Hudson@realpage.com,,,FALSE,FALSE,3,10-04-2016 16:20,FALSE,,TRUE,,,FALSE,500j000000Gqg4EAAR

Unfortunately my carrier is unavailable. I have been told they are actively investigating all the numbers that are listed as to be ported for you.

Can you please verify that NO numbers have ported and the rejection below is in regards to all numbers (attached)?

I want to ensure the list of numbers I have are the same as yours.

Hello,



It just came to our attention that a handful of our tracking numbers have
expired over the last several months.  Is there a possibility of
re-enabling these numbers?  If not, I?ll need to know specifically which
numbers are no longer active so we can re-assign them ASAP.

I have researched the option of putting a greeting on your (562) 331-1230 line, and I cannot find any cell service which plays an outbound greeting for an active call.  

Greetings are inserted, in our application between receiving the inbound call from a tracking number and connecting to the destination number.  It is this connection piece which allows us to ""insert"" a message. The only other place I see this type of service is within a PBX or phone server.  Again, this is ""inserting"" the message between receiving a call and connecting with an extension.  

So, with your current set-up there isn't a way to connect first to a message, and then back to the call.  Everything I find involves a voicemail greeting, which does not fit for what you are looking for.  

After looking at the available options, and understanding you have your number on advertising and want a consistent visitor experience, I would have to return to the  recommendation of porting the number in.    I can send the information on porting, if desired.

I just had a discussion with Abigail per your call this morning.   I think a general walk-through of our app might clear up some of her questions.   She mentioned that you would want to be involved in the walk-through so we should get all parties involved on the same call.  Chase is your account manager, I've included him in this e-mail.

Kellie, 
Yes, for 8667967286, it is under a ""TBD"" Campaign.  It would just need to have the campaign renamed.  I can do so if you wish.  Just let me know!

Kellie, 
There are now two campaigns for each number - the ""Ended"" campaigns will still be visible, however new campaigns with the same Name and settings were created, and you should be able to see those too.  

I've tested by calling, and they're now connecting to Clay Chevrolet.

Sorry if I am missing something, but I?m still seeing the ?recovered? ones
as ENDED.  Please see the attached.  Is there something I need to do to
extend them?



Also, we will need to reassign the below number so could you please let me
know the best way to do so?

Sorry for all the questions but this is all completely new to me and the

Please help me making sure CallShield is turned OFF for all the locations
in the accounts below. Instructions are below:

To turn off at account level:

In each account, go to Edit Account Features, under Account Feature
Defaults, set Callshield to OFF and this will set the default value
for all future campaigns to OFF.

To turn off at location level:

Then for each location, in Edit Location you will find a Callshield
field toward the bottom of the page. Set the value to OFF and it will
disable Callshield for all active campaigns within the location. The
new Callshield settings will take hold after the midnight cache
refresh.

Another question for you, is there a way that we could email our clients 
daily reports from Convirza? Also, I should let you know that I think we 
want to upgrade to one of your bigger plans. I am not sure what they are 
called. Could you send me what the plans include again? I think one was 
called the Dominator plan.

As is, the recommended method is to setup read only users under their respective groups inside your account with access only to their campaigns, so that they can login and view the reports for their numbers.

As for upgrading your current plan, we have a variety of different options. What were you looking to upgrade to in terms of how many numbers you would like, and whether or not you need Google Analytics integration and Conversation Analytics?

I don't think call duration is a good indicator if the call is spam.  They could simply be misdials or people who may call back later and you wouldn't wan't to stifle any possible business.   While we could do what you are asking it would be tedious for you as well as us to have to do that monthly.  We do have access to a great feature called SpamGuard. I have attached a document which goes over this product and its benefits.    SpamGuard does have overhead costs so it is not free to implement. Our pricing is based on call volume.  I've included Frank who is your account manager. If you are interested please let us know and we can get you a quote.

I am really frustrated to hear that the reason you want to cancel with us is because of our support team. I really don't ever want this to happen again and would like to better understand why you are cancelling. I went and talked with everyone that has been involved with your account and it sounds like there was a issue with not being able to set up DNI and also, us recommending not porting in your main line into our system. Is there any other details that I am missing?

Would it interest you to continue with us if we assigned you an account manager and put your account on hold for 30 days and see if we can get your DNI setup correctly? If we cannot setup the DNI in 30 days we will terminate  your account.

We have started the canceling process and will give you an update on Friday.

Yes I would be fine with holding off on terminating the account to see if we can get the DNI setup. Your service is exactly what I was looking for and I would love to get it working for me. The reason I wanted to cancel was because the support team wasn?t able to get DNI working and then no one contacted me for weeks after.

At the end of the day, I just want to be able to record and track the calls coming from online sources ? my website, Google, facebook, etc. Also, since I am not computer savvy, I would need someone to set that up for me ? which I explained the first time around and said I was fine paying for that service to have your support team do it for me ? which I am less inclined to pay for now given the poor customer service before I even get the service working.

If your company is able to do that for me ? great, I will be a happy customer. If not, then I would like the account to be cancelled.

Thanks,
Andrew Geistfeld

Thank you for following up with me.  I am new to City Pub and using Convirza so any help that can be provided is appreciated.  I have one customer set up right now and would be interested to see what types of reports I can provide back to the customer.  Monday would work well for me around 10 am west coast time if that works for you.

Todd and Liz,

Converza has never been informed that this number was sold in a lease to a
customer of Converza. I was asked for a quote about 866-TRUE BUYR, but
that?s all I know up to date.  I was only informed about the TEQUILA deal,
which may be released to Converza.  Todd, what?s going on with the 866-TRUE
BUYR?  Until I am told what the deal is with this number, it is not to be
moved away from Call Source.

Todd and Liz,

Converza has never been informed that this number was sold in a lease to a
customer of Converza. I was asked for a quote about 866-TRUE BUYR, but
that?s all I know up to date.  I was only informed about the TEQUILA deal,
which may be released to Converza.  Todd, what?s going on with the 866-TRUE
BUYR?  Until I am told what the deal is with this number, it is not to be
moved away from Call Source.

I sent the formal request for the credit to management for final approval.  They took a closer look.  Because we appreciate how long you have been with us we are going to give you the value of those lines for the 4 invoices that followed.   So you can expect a credit of $191.68 which will be applied to your next invoice.

Hi Tasha,

That number is set up for you on a Convirza platform, which is the reason that it isn't showing up on your regular Callsource platform.

I am going to try and find out if it can even be moved to the Callsource platform.  If not, you can always log into the Convirza system to pull reports but the reports won't be the same.

I?m reaching out because we are having a hard time with the reporting for one of our call tracking numbers.  When running the report for Lou Sobh Kia, there are no calls listed.

Can you please take a look at this as soon as you get a chance?

LOA) but the client had written down 8558814711.  Do you think that's what
caused the mismatch rejection?

- Copy of most recent bill from the current (losing) carrier
- Convirza Resporg Letter of Authorization (LOA) and/or Local LOA (We would like a separate LOA based on the type of number)
- Number Port Order Form (If you have more than 10 numbers please include the information needed on an Excel Spreadsheet)

Once we have the completed documentation we will process your request. If everything is in order you can expect to get a status on the request in 5-7 business days. 

My name is Chase Maires. If you have any questions please call 855-889-3939

get the email notification co-branded and let me know.

Am I to understand based on your request below, that you want to contact our customers directly to ensure they did not initiate the port?



If that assumption is correct, our customers purchase advertising through us.  It is InfoTel who is your customer.  You have access to which tracking numbers our customers are related to.  As well as what number it is connect or ?ring to?.  Our customers do not even know  their number is metered through Convirza.  They have all renewed their advertising within the last two months and all have chosen to continue to meter.



InfoTel is a small company.  We have two employees that deal with metering numbers, myself and Kate.  Neither of us have initiated this port or been contacted by any other organization to do so.



The three customers alone, that are no longer connecting to the published metered number, pay us a combined total of $1732.59 a month for their advertising.  So far that advertising has been ineffective for over one month already.  I would strongly suggest you escalate this to the highest level promptly as we will be looking to recover lost revenue.  Furthermore, I would suggest you stop charging our credit card on file for the monthly invoices.  As recent as October 10th we were charged.  Three of those numbers you don?t even have access to.



Please let me know how you intend to proceed.

Area Code-Prefix and/or Rate center: they have  385 number pool that they
want to be 801 numbers

Please complete client's request below and end the tracking numbers for
Taylor Heating. When completed , please respond to client on my behalf and
ask if she has some time for a walk through to show her how to end numbers.


When you do a walk through make sure client understands the difference
between ending a number and archiving the number.  (If you archive a number
the history will NOT remain in the system.).


There are 10 tracking numbers for Taylor Heating, please end them with
today's date.  Please cc me.  Thank you.

Hello Marty,

Taylor heating is no longer on our PFP program. We need to cancel the phone
numbers associated with this account and make sure we no longer get billed
for them. How do I go about doing this?



Thanks,

Hi Tom,

I can help you with that. Just to clarify, when you say name do you mean the name of the tracking number? If so, we do not have the feature the shows the name of the route on the phone when someone calls in. I can put that in as a feature request. You will see the name when you pull up the Call Details Reports after the call.

Hello Chase,



Thank you for following up with me. I am new to City Pub and using Convirza so any help that can be provided is appreciated. I have one customer set up right now and would be interested to see what types of reports I can provide back to the customer. Monday would work well for me around 10 am west coast time if that works for you.



Thanks and have a nice weekend,



Tom

The quickstart guide goes over adding numbers.   You can add numbers from the Campaign and Callflow link on the left navigation bar.  Caution, if you are acting as an agency for other companies, you will want to create your group hierarchy first  on the Group and User link.  Consider the Group the largest container that holds users, campaigns and numbers.  After you have your hierarchy created then you can add campaigns under each specific group. Campaigns are the next size down container which in turn hold Callflows (tracking numbers).  

If you get stuck it is a good idea to call into support (855-889-3939 option 2) and get a little training on adding numbers.

price and everything. She was suppose to do a Convirza on CallSource
Contract. This has been ongoing for 2 weeks now. She (Sandra)knows
everything about this one. The number has to be on a Convirza /Callsource
Vanity contract . I think it was 399 + 6.9 cents a min a month but you have
to look at her notes. It's non portable and non transferable.

We can help you out with that. I see your usage is down from about 370 numbers and 30,000 minutes per month during October 2015, to 65 tracking numbers and about 650 minutes per month now. We're sorry to see such a drop in usage of the application. 

Did you find that our app simply wasn't working for you? What can we do on our end to make the application more attractive and get your usage back up? Or perhaps this portion of your business has simply contracted? I'd just like to get more information concerning the drop in usage so that we can help you out in any way we can, and move forward with a more sensible plan.",,,Re: Subscription,,support@convirza.desk-mail.com,support@convirza.desk-mail.com,rjruel@garaga.com,,,FALSE,FALSE,3,10/13/2016 3:22:29 PM,FALSE,,TRUE,,,FALSE,500j000000KQ5a8AAD

The reason why we aren?t using Convirza as much anymore is because we are changing phone tracking number platform. This has been discussed already with some of your colleague, there were many things that weren?t working for us on Convirza this is why we needed to change platform.

What are our plan options ?

See attached. We would like 320 campaigns and call flows created in CFA.
These should be created under the groups listed on column A.

CFA Account Name: Water Place Media

I've already completed the first 5 so I could verify all information needed
was on the spreadsheet. You'll want to use a rate center lookup to find the
local numbers. If there aren't enough numbers for the rate center you need,
please use nearby rate centers.

We'd like this completed by Wednesday October 19th.

Please send a daily update to myself and Frank, fcarreno@convirza.com.

Thank You

Can you please confirm that the account has been closed? If the account
has not yet been closed, can you please close as soon as possible and
advise that it has been closed?
I am still seeing calls today on 423-278-9317, and Monday on 4237872498.
4237872448 and 4237872410 so please check with your new carrier regarding
the port.
Since we are the port-from party, we will only be notified well after a
port completes, so your best resource is going to be HPM. Once they have
confirmed they have ported these numbers, we will close the account. Or if
preferred I can close the account now, but that will mean the numbers will
no longer work, nor be portable after account closed.
Here are the numbers listed currently on the account:

Do you intend to cancel your account with us then at some point in the future?

As for the plans, it looks like your best options are either the Performance plan, starting at $199/month with 10 numbers, 10 users,  200 calls analyzed a month, and 1000 minutes per month, or the Optimizer plan, starting at $399/month that includes 100 tracking numbers, unlimited users, 2,000 minutes, 1,000 calls analyzed a month. It is $3.00 for additional numbers, and $0.059 for additional minutes for either plan.

Here is the description on our Data Append information: 

Our optional Data Append service captures and displays third-party data associated with the caller?s phone number by performing a Reverse Phone Number lookup. This data is displayed in a way that provides a consolidated view of caller information and can be leveraged in many different ways to help drive strategic decision making. On 30 ? 45% of phone calls, we are able to acquire and display Business Name, Name, Gender, Address, City, State, Zip Code, Country, Carrier, Rate Center, and if the caller is on the ?Do Not Call? (DNC) or 'Do Not Mail' (DNM) list. This data will be displayed on the 'Calls'> 'Details'> 'Info' tab.

There is no additional cost for taking advantage of this service.

Note:  when available, you will see this info on the Call Details reporting under ""More Info"" and it should show up in reports downloaded.",,,Data Append Service,,support@convirza.desk-mail.com,support@convirza.desk-mail.com,tom@citypubdelval.com,,,FALSE,FALSE,3,10/13/2016 8:24:36 PM,FALSE,,TRUE,,,FALSE,500j000000KQKbLAAX

We notice this behavior most often associated with VOIP connected phones when they are experiencing low bandwidth, especially when the pin will work from other phones.  There is something about the connection which doesn't pick up the tones for the PIN, and will replay the prompt to enter.  My suggestion is to try from another phone - try from a cell phone if you're using a desk phone for instance to test to see if it is a PIN issue or a connection issue.  

I know I have tested your number before, and I have again, and it does accept the PIN.  

Let me know if the scenario above applies? or if not, please let me know what set up you are working with, and I will continue to troubleshoot.",,,Re: Dial out problems,,support@convirza.com,support@convirza.com,gabbott@chamberdiscoveries.com,,,FALSE,FALSE,3,10/13/2016 8:30:12 PM,FALSE,,TRUE,,,FALSE,500j000000KQQARAA5

Per our conversation today, I have submitted a request internally to extend the recording links to 30 days before expiration. I will keep you posted as to our completion. 

We also talked about doing a custom greeting that you can add to your tracking number lines.  As mentioned, we do have access to professional voice over actors.  In general we can do Male or Female, American (no accent) and British accent.   If you want other accents we can look into the possibility. 

We would need a script from you of 100 words or less.  You can go over 100 but it would be at an extra charge.   I would suggest including the ""call recording disclaimer"" verbiage if you have enough words left.  

Turn around time to get the recording back varies but will be typically done in about 3 days. 

We can get this done for you for $40.00.   We will only bill upon your approval. 

I can also get some samples to you mid next week if necessary.  (They won't be specific to Neighborhood Tire Pros) 

Otherwise, once we get the script from you we can get started. Let me know what you think.",,,Custom Greeting,,support@convirza.desk-mail.com,support@convirza.desk-mail.com,jbaxtereei@gmail.com,jmunk@convirza.com,,FALSE,FALSE,3,10/13/2016 9:43:13 PM,FALSE,,TRUE,,,FALSE,500j000000KQShhAAH

You may attempt to troubleshoot with Time-Warner, or depending on how technical you are, you might google your phone model and see if ""the internet"" can suggest remedies. (My personal method.) Time-Warner might also have dealt with these types of issues before, and might have suggestions?

The trouble is not the necessarily the amount of bandwidth you have available, but the use at the time of the call.  Big emails or data uploads/downloads or other programs might be challenging your connection at the same time the phone is attempting to use it.  The specific issue is our program depends on detecting the DTMF tones when you key in your PIN, and when it fails, it is not picking up the tones, or its getting partial input and considers it an incorrect PIN.

I know that these numbers are planning to port in tomorrow and I could not
see them in the CFA inventory. Kami can you work with Ali on when you are
going to release these numbers and so he can provision them ?

Hi Ali,

Do have time to provision 9 numbers. Work with Kami on when we can
provision these number. Definitely, ASAP. I have already created the
campaigns I attached a sheet with all of the numbers that need to be
provisioned minus the 866 numbers.

I came across a 2015 Daily Herald article about Convirza and found it really interesting. The concept that ""...if you make a call, you're ready to buy."" is so true! I had never realized that, but if I'm willing to call and not just do the research on my smartphone, I have every intention of purchasing. That is, if the customer service is good. Anyway, it looks like you've done great things since 2001.

Do you keep a list of voice talent available for your projects? I?m a full-time voice-over artist, specializing in explainer videos for customers and employees. I produce and master audio from my professional home studio. My demo and experience are available at www.tiarider.com.

It would be great to connect and chat about working together.

If you login in to the ""Reporting"" side of the Calltrack platform as opposed to the ""Provisioning"" side you can manage your reports.   You can get there directly using this link: http://www.callsource.com/home/reporting-login/

I can also assist in doing the report but would need more information to do so.   Are both reports the standard ""Call Details Report""  or are they supposed to be different.   Currently, I see only one configured report entitled ""Black Diamond"". This report is the standard Call Details report which is set to go on the 1st of each month going to these addresses:
rogerva@blackdiamondlandscape.com
itsrsvpsantaclara@gmail.com
leads@blackdiamondlandscape.com

Hey Audrey,

I accidentally deleted a phone number that was under smart 72 because it
was under the wrong campaign. I didn't realize the number would disappear
after doing this. Is it possible to recover the number or is it gone now?
The number is 805-222-4992.

Thank you,

Jon

Thank you for getting that taken care of with the tracking numbers. I 
spoke with our accountant today and we were wondering if it would be 
possible to have the monthly charge go to my credit card each month?

Also, I sent in some SSL certificate information a few weeks ago and I 
never heard anything about it. Did you receive that? Is there anything 
else you need from us? I tested out our Cname record and it didn't seem 
to be registering an SSL certificate.

Another thing, I was wondering if you could give me Convirza's API 
documentation and let me know if there are any charges that go along 
with using the API? We have a couple things that we would like to use 
the API for.

Thank you,

We have an account with you all and I had an advertiser ask me today why
some calls are recorded and some are not. I have noticed that in the past
but never investigated it. Can you please help me with this? If you are not
who I need to contact please let me know if there is a better person to
contact. Thank you!

I took a look at your calls for this month, and tested any lines which had the same caller ID calling back in a short timeframe, and all of the test calls were successful/I was able to get through. 

I did find one route with a problem: 
Nalley Jaguar - Asbury
Tracking Number: (888) 375-6372
Target Number: (770) 475-0030

This rings busy when connected, so I tested target number and it is also busy.  This route might need its target number updated.  

There was a significant telecom outage October 4th which affected a large percentage of the US, and large carriers Level 3 and ATT.  We were affected naturally, but we have not had telecom issues isolated to our services.  

If you are concerned about a route in particular, please give me the route name or tracking number and I will continue to troubleshoot.",,,RE: Interesting that you called...,,support@convirza.desk-mail.com,support@convirza.desk-mail.com,,support@convirza.com,,FALSE,FALSE,3,10/14/2016 8:39:15 PM,FALSE,,TRUE,,,FALSE,500j000000KR8waAAD

Marty reached out to me to create your Blacklist, and I wanted to follow up with you directly.  

You can see the Blacklist here in this screenshot:  http://screencast.com/t/TWRPaJfgyyiD  **note I added these at the top level, which has some implications I explain below.**

There are two ways to add numbers to the list: 
1- When reviewing calls in the Call Detail report, one of the options off to the right is to ""Block Number"" - simply clicking the button will add calling number to the Blacklist. 
2- Add numbers directly to the Blacklist section.  Simply paste in comma-separated 10 digit numbers without any additional characters.  

On the Blacklist page (under Settings->Customization) you may search numbers already listed and remove if desired.   Blacklist will automatically apply to new numbers added to a group. 

An additional feature built in is you can customize for specific customers.  If you have a number which you only want blocked for one of your groups, add blocking at the group level.  Navigate to the specific group (you should see it in the breadcrumb at top) and then to the Blacklist page in Settings and add numbers as described above.  Numbers on the list are blocked for the group and any subgroups. 

At your convenience, please take a look and let me know if you have any questions!

I apologizes for not responding in 24 hr time frame. But your numbers still have not ported in our system but after talking to our telecom department it sounds like all any submitted number ports should still be routed through Real Pages until they have been ported. I have tested the some on your lines which proved to be true. We are still working with the carrier.  I will update you in within 72hrs. (For real this time)

Thanks so much for looking into this for us!

Wondering if there are possibly any numbers that are even more simple than the ones you have listed? We could do a 1800 phone number if that gives us more flexibility. We just need to have really memorable phone numbers as the campaign is a radio campaign (so people will need to be able to essentially memorize the numbers while they are driving).

This would be for Tanner.  Is the pricing much different for Convirza for Advertisers from CQM?  Can you please provide that?

I help manage Tanner?s paid search efforts & Blaine is interested in being able to distinguish paid calls from organic calls.  We currently use his phone numbers on the site with Google?s forwarding numbers to track calls from ads in Google.  Is this something we can see within CQM?  To me, it looks like all ?organic? calls could be a combination of their organic and paid traffic.

Thank you.

Jeremy and I are making some changes to our convirza.com website.
One of the changes we are testing is to add a second dedicated Customer
Support phone number on the site.

My understanding is the currently we only have one phone number ((385)
695-3215) for convirza that goes to our IVR then goes to a hunt group based
on the IVR selection.

Can we create a new local Customer Support phone number that points
directly the the customer support (IVR option 2) hunt group?  We also want
to point the current local number ((385) 695-3215) directly to the IVR
option 1 hunt group.

Please let me know what you need from me to get this accomplished.
Thanks,

Ben,

That is the contact number for support. Our phone system forwards calls to
the customer support hunt group when option 2 is pressed.

Whats the problem that you are wanting to solve?

I have tested with me office phone and cellphone. Each time that I called there has been no problems with the connection. Any time the voice mail or office set up does not go through that can be fixed by the ring-to's carrier.  I have not been able to get call examples because every time I have call it has worked correctly. This could be a local issue but we can not find out anything with out call examples. If you could get a call example of the problem that will help us out tremendously. Just record the number of who called, the number they were trying to call,the date, time, and what happened in the phone call.

initially about adding the dedicated direct ring Sales number.

Darren suggested that this is a good time for us to be making these changes
since he's making changes as well.  I think you're okay with this change,
right Darren?

Darren, once Eric can get the CS number set up to ring directly to the
queue, I can set that 855 CS tracking number to point to that dedicated CS
number.

So here's a recap of the changes we'll need:

   - keep the currently live (385) 695-3215 phone number
   - point this current phone number directly to the Sales queue
   - create a new local direct phone number for Customer Support
   - point this new number to the Customer Support queue

Hope I didn't miss anything, and just let us know what that new Customer
Support number is, so we can point the appropriate tracking numbers to it.

Thanks,

When you say it's ""published locally"" I assume it's published primarily for
sales purposes and not customer support purposes.  I can't think of any
scenarios where we would have it published for a customer support purpose
except on our website.  So I think we are trying to achieve the same goal.

We want to maintain the same number on the website and all online
publications as well with the 3215 number.  That's why we want to continue
to use that number and just have it point directly to sales instead of
having the IVR.
If we really see that as a problem, then we can continue using the 3215
number as-is but still create a new sales only number and a new CS only
number pointing directly to the sales and CS queues respectively.

Thanks,

*Ben Tan* | Sales Engineer

we will display 2 numbers on the website? One for sales? And one for

Changing Campaigns over with their call flows to a different group is actually a substantial database manipulation.  We would have to move over the campaigns and call flows of course, but also the phone numbers, already created calls , and CA records. It may even lead to inconsistencies in reports.

Was hoping you could help me out with a couple of things:

 

1. I?m trying to make changes to some of my call flows (?Name? and ?Quantity? of numbers for the pool) ? after making the changes and hitting save, I get a pop up telling me that it?s saving, but when I click away and come back, the changes haven?t been saved. 

 

2. Is there a way to delete campaigns? Or should we just ?Archive? ones we no longer need? 

 

3. How can we add GA integration for all of our clients? In the GA integration section, it looks like there?s room to enter only one tracking code ? but all of our clients have their own unique tracking codes. 

 

Thanks,

Good Afternoon Marty,



I?m working with a client who is trying out print. They?d like to track its
performance and I?ll need 3 new numbers with a 317 area code. The account
name is JCC Indianapolis, account number 61554, and all three numbers need
to route to 317-251-9467.



Please reply all as I will be out of the office until next Tuesday.



Thanks,
